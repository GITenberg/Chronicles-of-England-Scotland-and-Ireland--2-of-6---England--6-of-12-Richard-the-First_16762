<h2>RICHARD THE FIRST,</h2>
<p class="bigger center">Second sonne to Henrie the second.</p>


<p style="margin-top:3em;">
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;1. <br />
1189.</span>
Richard the first of that name, and second sonne of Henrie the second,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
began his reigne ouer England the sixt day of Julie, in the yere of our
Lord 1189. in the seauen and thirteeth yeare of the emperour Frederike
the first, in the eleuenth yere of the reigne of Philip the second king
of France, and king William surnamed the Lion as yet liuing in the
gouernement of Scotland.</p>

<p>This Richard, immediatlie after the solemnities of his fathers funerals
were ended, made hast to Rouen, where he was ioifullie receiued, and
proclamed duke of Normandie, receiuing the inuesture according to the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
custome, on the twentith day of Julie. Then studieng to set all things
in good order on that side the sea, he made search where his fathers
<span class="rightnote">Stephan de Turnham committed to prison.</span>
treasure was preserued, and therevpon attached Stephan de Turnham, who
was seneschall or gouernour (as we may call him) of Aniou, and
committing him to prison, compelled him to make deliuerie of all such
summes of monie as he had hid and laid vp in certeine castels by the
commandement of the late king his father.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
Whilest he was thus occupied, his brother John came to him, to whom he
ioifullie gaue the welcome, and besides all other things which his
father had bequeathed vnto him by his testament in England, amounting to
the value of foure thousand pounds of yearelie rent, with the earledome
of Mortaigne, he procured a marriage for him (being now a
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" ></a><span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
widower) for
<span class="rightnote">Isabell daughter to the earle of Glocester married to John
y<sup>e</sup> kings brother.<br />
She is named by diuerse authors Hauisia. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
his further aduancement with the ladie Isabell, daughter to Robert earle
of Glocester, which earle had appointed the said John to be his heire as
before is mentioned, although Baldwine the archbishop of Canturburie
forbad the mariage, bicause they were coosens in the third degree of
consanguinitie. To Robert earle of Leicester also he restored all his
lands which had b&eacute;ene taken from him, and such persons as his father had
disherited, he restored likewise to their former rights and possessions,
howbeit those had forsaken his father, and taken part with him against
his said father, he s&eacute;emed now so much to mislike, that he remooued them
vtterlie from his presence, and contrariwise preferred such as had
continued faithfull vnto his father in time of the troubles.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
At length, king Richard remembring himselfe of his mother qu&eacute;ene
Elianor, who had b&eacute;ene separated from the bed of hir husband for the
space of sixt&eacute;ene yeares, and was as yet deteined in prison in England,
wrote his letters vnto the rulers of the realme, commanding them to set
<span class="rightnote">The kings mother set at libertie.</span>
hir againe at libertie, and withall appointed hir by his letters
patents, to take vpon hir the whole gouernment of the kingdome in his
absence. The qu&eacute;ene being thus deliuered, and hauing now the cheefe
authoritie &amp; rule in hir hands, rode in progresse about the realme, to
s&eacute;e the estate thereof; and as she passed from place to place, she
shewed gladsome countenance to the people wheresoeuer she came, dooing
also what she could to pleasure them, that she might thereby win their
good willes to hir, and to hir sonne: but speciallie remembring by hir
late experience and tast thereof, what an irksome &amp; most gr&eacute;euous thing
imprisonment was, she caused the gailes to be opened, and foorthwith set
no small number of prisoners at libertie by the way as she passed
through the countries, according to the verse of Virgil,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Non ignara mali miseris succurrere disco.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the meane time, king Richard concluding a league with Philip king of
France, receiued all those places againe which were taken from his
father by the same Philip, togither with his wife Adela, whom vpon
suspicion that she had beene dishonested in hir person before, without
anie sufficient proofe thereof had, he forsooke, &amp; sent hir home with
hir dowrie, and otherwise with great and princelie gifts, most
bountifullie inriched, hauing alreadie concluded a marriage with the
ladie Berengaria, daughter to Garsias king of Nauarre, who was sent into
Sicill vnto hir sister Joane, that he might marrie hir there, as he
passed that waie towards the holie land.</p>

<p>Whilest these things passed thus in these parties, the christians in
<span class="rightnote">The 2. kings of England &amp; France determine to go into the
holie land</span>
the holie land dailie sent hither for aid, wherevpon the two kings of
France and England tooke counsell togither, and determined with all
conuenient speed to ioine their powers, &amp; with ships prepared for that
purpose to saile into Syria. Hauing thus concluded, they went about to
prepare themselues of necessarie prouision for so long a iournie. Now
when king Richard had set in order his affaires in Normandie and France,
<span class="rightnote">At Southhampton the 21 of August saith <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i>
<i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
he came ouer into England, landing at Portesmouth the 13. of August.
With him also came his brother John, vnto whom he assigned the castels
of Marlebridge, Lutegareshall, Peake, Bollesour, the honor of
Wallingford, Tikehill and Eie, with the earledoms of Mortaigne, Dorset,
Sumerset, Notingham, Derbie, Deuonshire, and Cornewall, with the
earledome of Lancaster, intituling him earle of the same, whereby he was
so exalted in state and degree, that he s&eacute;emed in manner of a tetrarch,
hauing as it were a fourth part of the realme in gouernance: but yet the
king held some of the castels (in those counties and honors thus giuen
to his brother) in his owne hands. Moreouer, vnto William Marshall he
gaue in marriage the daughter of Richard earle of Chepstow, togither
with the earledome which hir father possessed: and to Gilbert Fitz Roger
the sonne of Rainfrey he gaue the daughter of William de Lancaster.
After he was landed (as before ye haue heard) he hasted to Winchester,
where his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor with the most part of the English
nobilitie had laine a good space to attend his comming, and there on the
euen of the assumption of our ladie, the king was by them receiued with
great ioy and triumph.</p>

<p>&para; Here is to be noted, that whilest the qu&eacute;ene and lords laie in
Winchester waiting for the kings arriuall, Geffrey Riddle the bishop of
Elie departed this life. He is named by
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" ></a><span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
Geruasius Dorobernensis the
proud bishop of Elie: but he might rather haue named him the rich
bishop, for he left in his cofers no small quantitie of treasure, of the
which thr&eacute;e thousand and two hundred marks came to the kings part
towards the charges of his coronation. No maruell though Geruasius spake
somewhat in his dispraise, for (as he himselfe confesseth) he was no
fr&eacute;end but an enimie to moonks.</p>

<p>But to let this passe, soone after the kings comming into England, he
was informed that the Welshmen had broken into the English marshes, and
destroyed certeine townes; to represse whose presumptuous attempts he
made towards them, but was yet staied for that time, &amp; reuoked by his
<span class="rightnote">His fathers treasure.</span>
mother. At Salisburie he found his fathers treasure, highlie reioising,
for that the summe was far greater than he thought it would haue
prooued, for besides the pretious stones, apparell, and iewels, it was
reported he had there the sum of nine hundred thousand pounds in readie
coine. With this good hap king Richard not a little aduanced, came to
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Gau.&nbsp;Vinsaf.</i> <i>Nic.&nbsp;Triuet.</i><br />
The second of September saith <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
London on the first of September, where he had appointed prouision to be
made for his coronation, and so calling a councell of the Nobles of the
realme, he receiued the crowne with all due and accustomed solemnitie,
at the hands of Baldwin the archbishop of Canturburie, the third daie of
September.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The order of his coronati&#333;. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
At his coronation, first the archbishops of Canturburie, Roan, Trier,
and Dublin, which were present, with all the other bishops, abbats, and
cleargie, apparelled in rich copes, and hauing the crosse, holie water
and censures carried afore them, came to fetch him vnto the doore of his
priuie chamber, and there receiuing him, they led him vnto the church at
Westminster, till he came before the high altar with a solemne
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
procession. In the middle of the bishops and cleargie went foure barons,
bearing candlesticks with tapers, after whom came Geffrey de Lucie
bearing the cap of maintenance, and John Marshall next to him, bearing a
great and massiue paire of spurs of gold: then followed William Marshall
earle of Striguill ali&agrave;s Pembroke, who bare the roiall scepter, in the
top wherof was set a crosse of gold: and William de Patrike earle of
Salisburie going next him, bare the warder or rod, hauing on the top
thereof a doue. Then came thr&eacute;e other earles, Dauid brother to the king
of Scots, the earle of Huntington, John the kings brother earle of
Mortaigne, and Robert earle of Leicester, ech of them bearing a sword
vpright in his hand with the scabberds richlie trimmed and adorned with
gold.</p>

<p>The earle of Mortaigne went in the midst betwixt the other two. After
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
them followed six earles and barons, bearing a checker table, vpon the
which was set the kings scochens of armes, and then followed William
Mandeuill earle of Albemarle, bearing a crowne of gold a great heigth
before the king, who followed the same, hauing Hugh bishop of Durham on
the right hand, and Reignold bishop of Bath on the left, ouer whom a
canapie was borne: and in this order he came into the church at
Westminster, where before the high altar in the presence of the cleargie
&amp; the people, laieng his hand vpon the holie euangelists and the relikes
<span class="rightnote">The king his oth.</span>
of certeine saincts, he tooke a solemne oth, that he should obserue
peace, honour, and reuerence to almightie God, to his church, and to the
ministers of the same all the daies of his life. Also that he should
exercise vpright iustice to the people committed to his charge, and that
he should abrogate and disanull all euill lawes and wrongfull customes,
if anie were to be found within the precinct of his realme, and
mainteine those that were good and laudable.</p>

<p>This doone, he put off all his garments from the middle vpwards, his
shirt excepted which was open on the shoulders, that he might be
annointed. The archbishop of Canturburie annointed him then in thr&eacute;e
places, to wit, on the head, on the shoulders, and on the right arme,
with praiers in such case accustomed. After this, he couered his head
with a linnen cloth hallowed, and set his cap aloft thereon; and then
when he had put on his roiall garments and vppermost robe, the
archbishop tooke vnto him the sword wherewith he should beat downe the
enimies of the church; which doone, two earles put his shoes vpon his
feet, and hauing his mantell put on him, the archbishop forbad him on
the behalfe of almightie God, not to presume to take vpon him this
dignitie
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" ></a><span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
except he faithfullie meant to performe those things which he
had there sworne to performe. Wherevnto the king made answer, that by
Gods grace he would performe them. Then the king tooke the crowne beside
the altar, and deliuered it to the archbishop, which he set vpon the
kings head, deliuering to him the scepter to hold in his right hand, and
the rod roiall in his left hand, &amp; thus being crowned he was brought
backe by the bishops and barons, with the crosse and candelsticks, and
three swords passing foorth before him vnto his seat. When the bishop
that sang the masse came to the offertorie, the two bishops that brought
him to the church, led him to the altar, and brought him backe againe.</p>

<p>Finallie when masse was doone, and all things ended in order as was
requisit, he was brought with solemne procession into his chamber, where
he put off his heauie rich apparell, and put on a crowne and other
garments more light and easie, and so went to dinner, whereat wanted no
store of meats &amp; drinks, which were serued out in most princelie and
bountifull wise.</p>

Vpon this daie of king Richards coronation, the Jewes that dwelt in
London and in other parts of the realme, being there assembled, had but
sorie hap, as it chanced. For they meaning to honour the same coronation
<span class="rightnote">The Jewes ment to present him with a rich gift.</span>
with their presence, and to present to the king some honourable gift,
whereby they might declare themselues glad for his aduancement, and
procure his freendship towards them, for the confirming of their
priuileges &amp; liberties, according to the grants and charters made to
them by the former kings: he of a zealous mind to Christes religion,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
abhorring their nation (and doubting some sorcerie by them to be
practised) commanded that they should not come within the church when he
should receiue the crowne, nor within the palace whilest he was at
dinner.</p>

<p>But at dinner time, among other that pressed in at the palace gate,
diuerse of the Jewes were about to thrust in, till one of them was
<span class="rightnote">A Jew striken.</span>
striken by a Christian, who alledging the kings commandement, kept them
backe from comming within the palace. Which some of the vnrulie people
perceiuing, and supposing it had b&eacute;ene doone by the kings commandement,
<span class="rightnote">The people fall vpon the Jewes and beat them.</span>
tooke lightlie occasion thereof, and falling vpon the Jewes with staues,
bats and stones, beat them and chased them home to their houses and
lodgings. H&eacute;erewith rose a rumor through the citie, that the king had
commanded the Jewes to be destroied, and therevpon came running
togither, to assault them in their houses, which when they could not
easilie breake vp nor enter, by reason the same were strongly builded,
<span class="rightnote">Their houses are set on fire.</span>
they set fire on them, so that diuers houses were consumed, not onelie
of the Jewes, but also of their neighbours, so hideous was the rage of
the fire. Here we see that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king being aduertised of this riotous attempt of the outragious
people, sent some of his councellours, as Ranulfe de Glanuille lord
Justice, and other officers to appease the tumult: but their authoritie
was nothing regarded, nor their persuasions any whit reuerenced, but
their thretnings rather brought themselues in danger of life among the
rude sort of those that were about to spoile, rob, and sacke the houses
and shops of the Jewes: to the better accomplishment of which their
vnlawfull act, the light that the fire of those houses which burned,
gaue after it was once night, did minister no small helpe and occasion
<span class="rightnote">Jewes burnt to death.</span>
of furtherance. The Jewes that were in those houses which were set on
fire, were either smoldred and burned to death within, or else at their
comming foorth most cruellie receiued vpon the points of speares,
billes, swords and gleaues of their aduersaries that watched for them
verie diligentlie.</p>

<p>This outrage of the furious and disordered people continued from the
middest of the one day, till two of the clocke on the other; the commons
all that while neuer ceassing their furie against that nation, but still
killing them as they met with any of them, in most horrible, rash and
vnreasonable maner. At length, rather wearied with their cruell dooings,
than satisfied with spoile, or mooued with respect of reason or
reuerence of their prince, they withdrew themselues from their riotous
enterprise, after they had executed
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" ></a><span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
manie vnlawfull and horrible
enormities. This great riot well deserued sore and gr&eacute;euous punishment,
but yet it passed ouer without correction, in respect of the great
number of the transgressors, and for that the most part of men for the
hatred generallie concerned against the obstinate frowardnesse of the
Jewes, liked the dooings hereof well inough, interpreting it to be a
good token, that the ioifull daie of the kings aduancement to the crowne
should be dolefull vnto the Jewes, in bringing them to such slaughter
and destruction. Finallie, after that the tumult was ceassed, the king
commanded that no man should hurt or harme any of the Jewes, and so they
were restored to peace, after they had susteined infinit damage.</p>

<p>&para; The occasion of this tragedie and bloudie tumult (redounding to the
Jewes great vexation and pitifull distresse, but to the satisfieng of
the peoples furious and vnbridled pronesse to crueltie) sprang
principallie from the king, who if he had not so lightlie esteemed of
the Jewes when they repaired vnto him with their present, in signe of
submission and hope of obteining their sute then purposed to be
exhibited; this hurlie burlie had not insued. For it was a violent
example &amp; a mightie motiue to the people to maligne the Jewes; as also a
hart-gr&eacute;efe to them in respect of their reiection, when the prince gaue
them so discourteous a repulse. Here therefore is to be obserued, that
the people is the princes ape, as one verie well saith. For looke
whereto he is inclined, note wherein he delighteth; the same is the
practise of the people: in consideration whereof the mightie ones of the
world haue speciall cause to haue an eie to their course of life, &amp; to
set caueats before their actions, that the people may in them s&eacute;e none
but good signes of commendable &amp; vertuous imitation. For</p>

<span class="rightnote">A councell at Pipewell.</span>
Shortlie after, to wit, the 15. day of September, a councell was holden
at Pipewell, where the bishops and abbats being assembled, there were in
presence of the king and of the archbishop of Canturburie elected
certeine bishops and abbats to such places as then were vacant: and
amongst other, William de Longchampe the kings chancellor was elected to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
the s&eacute;e of Elie, Geffrey the kings bastard brother vnto the
archbishoprike of Yorke, who was the 32. in number that had gouerned the
same, Geffrey de Lucie to Winchester, one Hubert Walter to Salisburie,
and Richard archdeacon of Elie, and the kings treasurer to the see of
London. The abbeies that were prouided of abbats were these,
Glastenburie, Shirborne, Persore and Feuersham. In like manner, John the
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Whitherne consecrated. <i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
elect of Whitherne was consecrated bishop of that see, by the hands of
the archbishop of Dublin. Also in this councell the king ordeined Hugh
bishop of Durham, and William Mandeuille earle of Albemarle, lord ch&eacute;efe
iustices of England, hauing deposed Ranulfe de Glanuille from that
roome.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the king being thus established in the estate of the kingdome,
did not forget his iournie which he had promised into the holie land,
but with all diligence made his prouision, and namelie he sought to
gather monie to furnish his charges, and so therevpon leuied a tax,
engaged, sold, and let to farme his lands, tols, customs, and other his
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Par.</i></span>
reuenewes, with certeine counties and offices, so that he made an
exceeding summe of monie. He also found, that Ranulfe de Glanuille lord
ch&eacute;efe iustice, and other of the head magistrates had not behaued
themselues vprightlie in the administration of their offices; so that he
both deposed the said lord cheefe iustice as is aforesaid, and almost
all the shiriffes and their deputies within the realme of England,
putting them to greeuous fines for their offenses and transgressions,
and so by that meanes he got no small deale of monie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
&para; Here note by the waie, how William Paruus affirmeth, that where this
Ranulfe Glanuille, being a man of high wisedome and stept into age, saw
that, manie things were doone
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207" ></a><span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
by the new king, not so aduisedlie, nor
with such foresight as they ought to be, sought of his owne accord to be
discharged of his office, that he might the better prepare himselfe to
go in that iournie to the holie land, as by taking vpon him the crosse
he had vowed in the daies of king Henrie, and so he solemnelie renounced
his office, which other (nothing so worthie of it) did afterwards inioy.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the king vnderstanding that Hugh Putsey or Pudsey bishop of
Durham, being a verie aged man, had much monie, he sold to him the
manour of Seggesfield or Sadberge, with the wapentake belonging to the
same, and also found meanes to persuade him to buy his owne prouince,
which he did, giuing to the king an inestimable summe of monie, and was
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Durham Sadberge.
The bishop of Durham made an earle.</span>
therevpon created an earle by the king for the same: wherevpon he was
intituled both bishop and earle of Durham, whereat the king would iest
afterwards and saie; "What a cunning craftesman am I, that haue made a
new earle of an old bishop?"</p>

<p>Furthermore, the same bishop gaue to the king a thousand markes to be
made ch&eacute;efe iustice of England, and that he might tarrie at home, and
not go into the holie land. And bicause he would not be reprooued of any
person, he obteined of the apostolike s&eacute;e (which faileth no man that is
surcharged with white or red mettall, and would be eased) a licence for
a summe of monie to be dispensed with for that iournie. The king thus
being earnestlie bent to make commoditie of those things, for the which
<span class="rightnote">The citizens of London present monie to the King. <br />
<i>Polydor.</i><br />
Liberties granted to London. Two bailiffes.</span>
he might get any monie at all, the citizens of London presented vnto him
a great summe towards the furnishing foorth of his enterprise. Wherevpon
to acquite their courtesie, he granted them large priuileges, and
ordeined that the citie should be ruled by two head officers, which they
should choose amongst themselues remoueable from yeare to yeare by the
name of bailiffes. The names of the two first bailiffes chosen by force
of that ordinance, were<a name="FNanchor_6_1" id="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, Henrie Cornehill, and Richard Fitz Reiner.</p>

<p>The citie before those daies euer since the comming in of William
Conquerour, and a good while before his time, was gouerned by certeine
<span class="rightnote">Port Greues.</span>
officers or rulers named Port Greues (which word is deriued of two Saxon
words, as Port and Greue. By Port is meant a towne, and by Greue a
gardian or ruler, as who should saie, A k&eacute;eper or ruler of a towne.)
These rulers with<a name="FNanchor_6_2" id="FNanchor_6_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the lawes &amp; customes then vsed within this citie, were
registered in a booke called (as some haue said) Doomesdaie, but through
negligence after these lawes and customes were changed and altered, the
booke was lost, so that the remembrance of such rulers as were before
the daies of this Richard the first are not to be had. These bailiffes
euer entred at Michaelmasse, and so continued foorth their yeare.</p>

<p>Thus began the citie first to receiue the forme and state of a
common-wealth, and to be diuided into felowships, which they call crafts
or corporations. Such also are admitted to the fellowships of these
<span class="rightnote">Apprentises.</span>
companies, as haue truelie serued as apprentises a certeine number of
yeares, as seuen at the least, vnder which time of seruice expired,
there is none made fr&eacute;e, nor suffered to inioy the liberties of that
<span class="rightnote">Fr&eacute;emen.</span>
citie, sauing such as are borne free, that is to saie, of fr&eacute;emen within
the citie, of whome at this time, it is not much materiall to make any
further report. The citie thus consisting of the said craftes or
occupations, chooseth out of the same a senat or companie of graue
councellours, whom they name Aldermen (E) changed into (A) according to
<span class="rightnote">Wards.</span>
the old Saxon pronuntiation. It is also diuided into 26. tribes or
wards, of the which euerie one hath his seuerall Alderman, or ouerseer,
who haue both authoritie sufficient, and large priuileges to mainteine
the good gouernement of their portions withall. Out of the number of
these, there is another officer yearelie chosen and appointed, called
<span class="rightnote">The Maior.</span>
the Maior, who ruleth all the rest.</p>

<p>But now to returne vnto the further dooings of king Richard before his
departure out of England towards his iournie into the land of Palestine,
commonlie called Holie land, it is said, he made such sale of things
apperteining to him, as well in right of the crowne,
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" ></a><span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
as otherwise, that
it s&eacute;emed to diuerse he made his reckoning neuer to returne againe, in
so much that some of his councellours told him plainelie, that he did
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard setteth things on sale. <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i>
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
not well in making things awaie so freelie, to the dishonoring of his
maiestie, and preiudice of his successour; vnto whome he answered, "that
in time of need it was no euill policie for a man to help himselfe with
his owne," and further ioined hereto these words, "that if London at
that time of n&eacute;ed would be bought, he would surelie sell it, if he might
m&eacute;et with a conuenient merchant that were able to giue him monie inough
for it."</p>

<p>Another way he had also to gather riches, and that was this. He had a
licence of pope Innocent the third, to dispense with such as pleased him
within his realme, for their vowes made to go into the holie land,
although they had taken on them the crosse for that purpose, namelie
such as he should appoint to remaine behind him for the defense of his
countrie: and of these also he tooke abundantlie, and diuerse other he
compelled to fine, namelie, to the end that he might get their monie
likewise, that hereby he obteined no small summe toward the furniture of
his iournie. But both pope &amp; prince forgat in the meane while, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Boni pastoris est tondere pecus non excoriare.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This yeare also in the moneth of Nouember, as Matthew Paris saith,
Johannes de Anagnia a cardinall and legat from the pope arriued here in
England, comming on land at Douer, and bicause the king was as then in
the north parts, the same cardinall was prohibited on the behalfe of the
kings mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor, to passe any further without the kings
commandement. And so he staied there thirt&eacute;ene daies at the charges of
the archbishop of Canturburie, till the king came to those parties, by
whose wisedome a direction was taken for the quieting of the
controuersie betwixt the archbishop, and the moonkes of Canturburie, for
the chappell church of Hakington now called S. Stephans.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
In the same moneth of Nouember, by the kings appointment, Geffrey the
elect of Yorke, who was the kings brother, with other barons and lords
<span class="rightnote">William king of Scots.</span>
of Yorkeshire, receiued William king of Scotland at the water of Tweed,
and from thence with all due reuerence and honour they brought him vnto
<span class="rightnote">A councell called at Canturburie. <br />
<i>Polydor.</i> <br />
An oth.<br />
<i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Canturburie, where the king had called a councell of the lords of his
realme both spirituall and temporall, in the which euerie of them tooke
an oth to be true to the king, and to continue in due obedience vnder
him and his lawes, which oth also the king of Scots receiued, being
there present, and likewise king Richards brethren earle John and
Geffrey the archbishop of Yorke.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
The king of Scots therefore hauing receiued this oth, and thinking the
time to serue his purpose for red&eacute;eming of those castels, which were
deliuered to king Henrie as gages for his ransome, paid now vnto king
<span class="rightnote">Restitution made to the K. of Scots. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
Richard ten thousand markes, and had restitution for the same, that is
of Berwike, Roxburgh, Sterling, and Edenburgh. But William Paruus
saieth, that Edenburgh was restored to him in the daies of king Henrie,
by reason of his wife which he tooke in the parties beyond the seas: and
herewith agr&eacute;eth the Scotish chronicle. King Richard also assigned to
queene Elianor his mother, the accustomed dower, with manie lordships
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
and honours beside, as an augmentation thereof. About which time died
William de Mandeuille earle of Albemarle at Rouen, and Hugh de Putsey
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
the nephue of the bishop of Durham died at Aclet, and was buried at
Durham. Also Formalis archbishop of Trier died at Northampton, and was
there buried in the church of S. Andrews.</p>

<p>In the meane time, king Richard still desirous to furnish himselfe with
monie, deuised yet another shift, and feigned that he had lost his
seale; wherefore he commanded a new to be made, which being doone, he
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
caused it to be proclaimed and published in euerie countrie, that those
to whome he had granted any thing by his d&eacute;ed or charter, meaning to
inioy the same in suretie, should not thinke it much to come and haue it
confirmed by his new seale, least afterward the other being lost, their
lawfull titles might be called into question. Wherevpon manie that could
not come to him whilest he was in England,
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" ></a><span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
were glad to follow him, and
saile ouer into Normandie, and there to fine at his pleasure for the new
seale, to the end that their writings might be confirmed thereby, and
made so much the more sure to them and their successours. For the same
businesse also Remigius the prior of S. Albons, and manie other went
ouer to their great costs, charges, and trauell, after he was
transported into France.</p>

<p>I find moreouer about the same time, that the kings brother earle John
exhibited a sore complaint against the Romane legat and other bishops,
for that the archbishop of Canturburie, after the appeale made vnto the
apostolike sea, had put his lands vnder interdiction for his mariage
made with the earle of Glocesters daughter: which when the legat heard,
he foorthwith confirmed the appeale, and released the earles lands of
the aforesaid interdiction. The same time also, the tenth part of all
the mooueable goods thorough the realme of England was leuied to the aid
of the warres in the holie land. And this collection passing vnder the
name of an almes, was extended vpon the goods as well of the spirituall
men as temporall.</p>

<p>After all this, K. Richard desirous to set order in the gouernment of
<span class="rightnote">Hugh bishop of Durham gouerneth the north parts.
<i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
his realme, appointed Hugh bishop of Durham to haue the rule of the
north parts as cheefe iustice from Humber northwards toward Scotland,
deliuering vnto him also the keeping of Winchester castell: the residue
of the kingdome (with the custodie of the towre) he assigned to the
<span class="rightnote">William L&#333;gchampe bishop of Elie.</span>
gouernance of William Longchampe bishop of Elie, whome he had made
cheefe iustice of that part, and chancellour of the realme, a man of
great diligence and knowledge in the administration of things, but verie
factious and desirous of rule, honour and riches farre aboue all
measure. And with these two he ioined in commission Hugh Bardulfe,
William Marshall earle of Chepstow, or rather Penbrooke, Geffrey
Fitz-Peter, &amp; William Brewer, men of great honour, wisedome, and
discretion.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> King Richard passeth ouer in to Normandie.</span>
On the fift day of December, he departed from Canturburie, and went to
Douer, there to take water, and so on the eleuenth day of December he
passed ouer vnto Calice, where he found Philip earle of Flanders readie
to receiue him, who attended vpon him till he came into Normandie, where
<span class="yearnote">1190.</span>
the king held his Christmas at Burun, and immediatlie came to an
enteruiew with the French king at Gue S. Remige, where they concluded
<span class="rightnote"><i>Vadum sancti Remigij.</i> A league betwixt y<sup>e</sup> kings of England
and France.</span>
peace togither, to be kept betwixt them &amp; their countries on ech part;
the which was put in writing, and confirmed with their oths and seales

<p>&para; Some write, that now at this present, the king should ordeine or
rather confirme the bishop of Elie his chancellour to be lord ch&eacute;efe

from Trent northwards. But whensoeuer they were thus aduanced to such
dignities, howsoeuer they came by them, directlie or indirectlie, true
it is, that immediatlie therevpon, strife and discord did arise betwixt
them: for waxing proud and insolent, they disdained ech other,
contending which of them should bare most rule and authoritie, insomuch
that whatsoeuer s&eacute;emed good to the one, the other misliked, as in cases
where<a name="FNanchor_6_3" id="FNanchor_6_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> parteners in authoritie are equall, it often happeneth. The like
hereof is noted before betw&eacute;ene the archbishops of Canturburie and Yorke
in diuerse kings reignes. For the nature of ambition is to delight in
singularitie, to admit no peere, to giue place to no superior, to
acknowledge no equall. Hereto alludeth the poet verie neatlie, and
exemplifieth it in the old Romans, the order of whose actions is

<p>Moreouer, at the same time he caused his two brethren, earle John, and
Geffrey the elect archbishop of Yorke to take an oth not to returne into
England during the terme of thr&eacute;e yeares next insuing, without his
consent and licence first had. This he did, fores&eacute;eing what might
happen, prouiding as it were against such practises as his brethren
might happilie attempt against him. But yet his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor
procured him to reuoke that decree immediatlie, least it might seeme to
the world, that hir sonnes should stand in feare one of another. And so
<span class="rightnote">Erle John licenced to returne into England.</span>
the earle of Mortaigne was licenced to returne into England at his
pleasure, swearing an oth at his departure to obeie the kings beheast,
and truelie to serue him, according to the dutie of a good and loiall
subiect. The bishop of Elie lord chancellour and cheefe iustice of
England was also sent backe hither into this realme, to set forward
things behoouefull for the kings iournie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Elie returneth.</span>
In like maner the king sent to Rome to obteine that the said bishop of
Elie might be constituted the popes legat through both the prouinces of
Canturburie and Yorke, and likewise through Wales and Ireland. Which was
soone granted by the bulles of pope Clement the third, bearing date the
5. of June. For the which office the bishops gaue him 1500. marks, to
the great offense of the king, as he shewed afterward to cardinall
Octauian that came to visit him when he arriued in the riuer of Tiber,
being vpon his iourneie towards Messina, as after may appeare. But in
the meanetime, calling togither the lords, and peeres of those his
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
dominions on that side the sea, to wit, Normandie, Britaine, Aniou,
Poitou, and Guien, he consulted with them what number of soldiors and
how many ships it should be conuenient for him to take with him and
furnish into Asia: and herewith he did command them also to obeie Robert
earle of Leicester, whome he appointed to remaine amongst them as his
lieutenant or vicegerent of those parts during his absence.</p>

<p>&para; But here to leaue king Richard in consultation for matters
appertaining to his iournie, and shew brieflie what happened (by the
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
waie) to the Jewes, which as then dwelt heere in England, after that
king Richard was passed ouer into Normandie: ye haue heard how after the
riot against them at London, when the king was crowned, he tooke order
that they should remaine in peace vnder his protection, and commanded
that no person should in anie wise molest them. But now after that he
was gone ouer, and that the souldiers (which prepared themselues to
follow him) began to assemble in routs, the heads of the common people
began to wax wild and faine would they haue had some occasion of raising
<span class="rightnote">The hatred borne to the Jewes.</span>
a new tumult against the Jewes, whome (for their vnmercifull vsurie
practised to the vndooing of manie an honest man) they most deadlie
hated, wishing most earnestlie their expulsion out of England. Hervpon
by reason of a riot committed latelie against them, at the towne of Lin
in Norfolke, where manie of them were slaine, other people in other
parts of the realme, taking occasion hereat, as if they had b&eacute;ene called
vp by the sound of a bell or trumpet, arose against them in those townes
where they had any habitations, and robbed and bet them after a
disordered and most riotous maner.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Iohn&nbsp;Textor.</i></span>
As at Stamford (on the faire day in Lent); at Lincolne and at Yorke, in
which citie
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" ></a><span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
after a number of them had b&eacute;ene besieged certeine daies
within a towre of the kings (whither they fled for succour) one of their
<span class="rightnote">Fiue hundred saith <i>Houeden</i> and <i>Textor</i></span>
learned gouernours caused foure hundred of their companie to consent to
haue their throts cut one at an others hands, he himselfe cutting his
wiues throt first, whose name was Anna, then his childrens, one after
another, and last of all slue himselfe onelie rather than he would fall
into the hands of the christians, that had thus long besieged them. The
rest perceiuing what their great Rabbi had doone, set fire vpon all
their goods and substance, which they had gotten into the tower with
them, and so consuming the same, would haue burnt also the residue of
their fellowes which would not agr&eacute;e to the Rabbies counsell, in the
cruell murthering of themselues, if they had not taken a strong turret
hard by within that tower, and defended themselues both from the fire
and crueltie of their brethren, who had made awaie themselues in such
manner as I haue said: and that to the number of foure hundred, or (as
some write) fiue hundred at the least.</p>

<p>On the morow, those that were saued, called out to the people, and not
onelie shewed how and after what sort their fellowes were dispatched,
but also offered to be baptised, and forsake their Judaisme, if they
might haue their liues saued from the imminent &amp; present danger wherein
they saw themselues to be wrapped, through the furie of the people. To
be short, this thing was granted, and they came foorth, howbeit they
were no sooner entred into the prease, but they were all slaine, and not
one man of them preserued.</p>

<p>After this also, the people ran to the cathedrall church, and broke into
those places where their bonds and obligations laie, by the which they
had diuerse of the kings subiects bound vnto them in most vnconscionable
sort, and for such detestable vsurie as (if the authors that write
thereof were not of credit) would hardlie be beleeued. All which
euidences or bonds they solemnelie burned in the middest of the church.
After which, ech went his waie, the souldiers to the king, and the
commons to their houses, and so was the citie quieted. This happened at
Yorke on Palmesundaie eeue, being the 17. of March: and vpon the 15. of
that moneth, those that inhabited in the towne of S. Edmundsburie in
Suffolke, were set vpon, and manie of them slaine. The residue that
escaped, through the procurement of the abbat then named Samson, were
expelled, so that they neuer had anie dwellings there since that time.</p>

<p>Thus were the Jewes vnmercifullie dealt with in all places in maner
through this realme, the first beginning whereof chanced at London (as
before ye haue heard) and the next at Lin, of which I thinke it good to
note some part of the maner therof, although breeflie, and so to returne
to my purpose. The occasion therefore of the tumult at Lin chanced by
this meanes: it fortuned that one of the Jewes there was become a
christian, wherewith those of his nation were so mooued, that they
determined to kill him where soeuer they might find him. And herevpon
they set vpon him one daie as he came by, through the streets: he to
escape their hands fled to the next church; but his countriemen were so
desirous to execute their malicious purpose, that they followed him
still, and inforced themselues to breake into the church vpon him.
Herewith the noise being raised by the christians that sought to saue
the conuerted Jew, a number of mariners being forreners, that were
arriued there with their vessells out of sundrie parts, and diuerse also
of the townesmen came to the rescue, and setting vpon the Jewes, caused
them to flee into their houses.</p>

<p>The townesmen were not verie earnest in pursuing of them, bicause of the
kings proclamation and ordinance before time made in fauour of the
<span class="rightnote">The slaughter made of the Jews at Lin.</span>
Jewes: but the mariners followed them to their houses, slue diuerse of
them, robbed and sacked their goods, and finallie set their dwellings on
fire, and so burnt them vp altogither. These mariners being inriched
with the spoile of the Jewes goods, and fearing to be called to accompt
for their vnlawfull act by the kings officers, got them foorthwith to
shipboord, and hoising vp sailes, departed with their ships to the sea,
and so escaped the danger of that
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" ></a><span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
which might haue b&eacute;ene otherwise laid
to their charge. The townesmen being called to an accompt excused
themselues by the mariners, burdening them with all the fault. But
although they of Lin were thus excused, yet they of Yorke escaped not so
easilie. For the king being aduertised of such outrage, doone contrarie
to the order of his lawes and expresse commandement, wrote ouer to the
bishop of Elie his chancellour, charging him to take cruell punishment
of the offenders.</p>

<p>The bishop with an armie went to Yorke, but the cheefe authors of the
riot hearing of his comming, fled into Scotland: yet the bishop at his
comming to the citie, caused earnest inquirie to be made of the whole
matter. The citizens excused themselues, &amp; offered to proue that they
were not of counsel with them that had committed the riot, neither had
they aided nor comforted them therein an anie maner of wise. And in d&eacute;ed
the most part of them that were the offenders, were of the countries and
townes n&eacute;ere to the citie, with such as were crossed into the holie
land, and now gone ouer to the king, so that verie few or none of the
substantiall men of the citie were found to haue ioined with them.
<span class="rightnote">The citizens of Yorke put to their fine for slaughter of the
Jewes.</span>
Howbeit this would not excuse the citizens, but that they were put to
their fine by the stout Bishop, euerie of them paieng his portion
according to his power and abilitie in substance, the common sort of the
poore people being pardoned, and not called into iudgement, sith the
ringleaders were fled and gone out of the waie: and thus much by waie of
digression touching the Jews.</p>

<p>Now to returne vnto the king, who in this meane time was verie busie to
prouide all things necessarie to set forward on his iournie; his ships
which laie in the mouth of the riuer of Saine, being readie to put off,
he tooke order in manie points concerning the state of the common-wealth
on that side, and ch&eacute;efelie he called to mind, that it should be a thing
necessarie for him, to name who should succeed him in the kingdome of
England, if his chance should not be to returne againe from so long and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;West.</i></span>
dangerous a iournie. He therefore named (as some suppose) his nephue
Arthur, the sonne of his brother Geffrey duke of Britaine, to be his
successour in the kingdome, a yoong man of a likelie proofe and
princelie towardnesse, but not ordeined by God to succ&eacute;ed ouer this
kingdome.</p>

<p>About the same time the bishop of Elie, lord chancellour and cheefe
iustice of England, tooke vp to the kings vse, of euerie citie in
England two palfries and two sumpter horsses, &amp; of euerie abbeie one
palfrie and one sumpter horsse, &amp; euerie manour within the realme found
also one palfrie and one sumpter horsse. Moreouer, the said bishop of
Elie, deliuered the gouernement of Yorkeshire to his brother Osbert de
Longchampe: and all those knights of the said shire, the which would not
come to make answer to the law vpon summons giuen them, he commanded to
be apprehended and by and by cast in prison. Also when the bishop of
Durham was returned from the king and come ouer into England to go vnto
his charge, at his meeting with the lord chancellour at Elie
(notwithstanding that he shewed him his letters patents of the grant
made to him to be iustice from Trent northward) the said lord
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Durham restreined of libertie.</span>
chancellour taking his iournie to Southwell with him, there deteined him
as prisoner, till he had made surrender to him of the castell of
Windsor, &amp; further had deliuered to him his sonnes, Henrie de Putsey,
and Gilbert de la Ley, as pledges that he should keepe the peace against
the king and all his subiects, vntill the said prince should returne
from the holie land. And so he was deliuered for that time, though
shortlie after, and whilest he remained at Houeden, there came to him
Osbert de Longchampe the lord chancellours brother, and William de
Stuteuille, the which caused the said bishop to find sufficient suretie
that he should not thence depart without the kings licence, or the lord
chancellors, so long as the king should be absent. Herevpon the bishop
of Durham sent knowledge to the king how and in what sort he had b&eacute;ene
handled by the chancellor.</p>

<p>In the meane time the king was gone into Gascoigne, where he besieged a
<span class="rightnote">William de Chisi.</span>
castell that belonged to one William de Chisi, and tooke both the
castell and the owner, whome he
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" ></a><span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
caused to be hanged for the spoiles and
robberies which he had committed vpon pilgrims that passed by those
parts toward Compostella, to visit the bodie of saint James. After this,
the king came backe vnto Chinon in Aniou, and there tooke order for the
<span class="rightnote">The kings nauie is set foorth.<br />
Baion.<br />
Sablius, or Sabuille.</span>
setting foorth of his nauie by sea, ouer which he appointed ch&eacute;efe
gouernours Gerard archbishop of Aux, Bernard bishop of Baieux, Robert de
Sablius, Richard de Camuille<a name="FNanchor_6_4" id="FNanchor_6_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and William de Fortz de Vlerun, commanding
all those that should passe foorth with his said nauie, to be obedient
vnto these persons as his deputies and lieutenants. Herewith they were
appointed to prouide victuals to serue all those that should go by sea
for the space of 60 daies.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
The king also made the same time certeine ordinances to be obserued
among the seafaring men which tended to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Slaiers of men.</span>
1 First, that if any man chanced to slea an other on the shipboord, he
should be bound to the dead bodie and so throwne into the sea.</p>

<p>2 Secondlie, if he killed him on land, he should yet be bound to him as
before, and so buried quicke togither.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Brallers. Punishment for blouddrawers.</span>
3 Thirdlie, if any man should be conuicted by lawfull witnesse, that he
drew any weapon to strike any other, or chanced by striking at any man
to draw bloud of him that was smitten, he should lose his hand.</p>

<p>4 Fourthlie, if he gaue but a blowe with his fist without bloudshedding,
he should be plunged three seuerall times ouer head and eares in the
water.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Reuilers.</span>
5 Fifthlie, if any man reuiled another, he should for euerie time so
misusing himselfe, forfeit an ounce of siluer.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Theft and pickeries.</span>
6 Sixtlie, that if anie man were taken with theft or pickerie, and
thereof conuicted, he should haue his head polled, and hot pitch powred
vpon his pate, and vpon that, the feathers of some pillow or cushion
shaken aloft, that he might thereby be knowne for a theefe, and at the
next arriuall of the ships to any land, be put foorth of the companie to
seeke his aduenture, without all hope of returne vnto his fellowes.</p>
</div>

<p>These were the statutes which this famous prince did enact at the first
for his nauie, which sithens that time haue been verie much inlarged.
About the same time John Bishop of Whiterne in Scotland, suffragane to
the church of Yorke, ordeined Geffrey archbishop of Yorke, pr&eacute;est. At
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
the same season also the election of the same Geffrey was confirmed by
pope Clement, who among other things that he wrote to the chapiter of
Yorke on his behalfe, in the end he addeth these words: "We do therefore
admonish you all, and by the apostolicall bulles command you, that you
exhibit both reuerence and honour vnto him as vnto your prelat, that
thereby you may appeare commendable both before God and man. Giuen at
Lateran in the nones of March and third yeare of our gouernment."</p>

<p>Whilest these things were in dooing, there came into France legats from
the said Clement, to mooue the two kings to make all the sp&eacute;ed possible
towards their iourneie, bicause of the great danger wherein things stood
in Palestine, requiring present helpe. Herevpon king Richard (his men
and prouision being readie) commanded that his ships should set forward,
&amp; to coast about by the streicts of Giberalterre to come vnto
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> King Richard set forward on his iournie.
<i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Marseilles, where he appointed to m&eacute;et them, and so with a chosen
companie of men he also set foorth thitherwards by land, and comming to
Tours, receiued the scrip and staffe as a pilgrime should, at the hands
of the archbishop there.</p>

<p>After this, both the kings of England and France met at Vizeley in the
octaues of the natiuitie of S. John Baptist, and when they had remained
there two daies they passed foorth to the citie of Lion; where the two
kings departed in sunder, and each one kept his iournie, the one toward
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;2.</span>
Guenes, where his nauie was appointed to come to him, and the other to
Marseilles, there to m&eacute;et with his fl&eacute;et, according to his appointment.
<span class="rightnote">The English fl&eacute;et staied by contrarie winds.</span>
But the English ships being let and staied by the way by contrarie winds
and rigorous tempests, which tossed them<a name="FNanchor_6_5" id="FNanchor_6_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to and fro vpon the coasts of
Spaine, could not come in
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" ></a><span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
any conuenient time vnto Marseilles, so that
king Richard thinking long to tarrie for them, &amp; perceiuing they could
<span class="rightnote">Twentie gallies &amp; twelue other vessels saith <i>Houed.</i>
Vpon the seauenth day of August saith <i>Houeden</i>.</span>
not k&eacute;epe their appointed time, he hired ships from all places
thereabouts, and embarking himselfe and his men in the same, vpon saint
Laurence
euen, sailed foorth towards Sicile, where he was appointed to
m&eacute;et with king Philip.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Here is to be noted, that king Richard made not all that iourneie from
Marseilles to Messina by sea, but sundrie times comming on land, hired
horsses, and rode foorth alongst the coast, appointing with his ships
and gallies where to meet him, and sometimes he rested certeine daies
togither in one place or other as at Portdelphin, at Naples, and at
Salerne, from whence there departed from him Baldwine archbishop of
Canturburie, Hubert bishop of Salisburie, and the lord Ranulfe de
Glanuille, the which taking vpon them to go before, with prosperous wind
and weather in short space landed at Acon, which was then besieged, as
you shall heare hereafter.</p>

<p>At Rome the king came not, but being within the streame of the riuer of
Tiber, there came to him a cardinall named Octauianus, bishop of Hostia,
<span class="rightnote">King Richard blameth the court of Rome for couetousnesse.</span>
to whome be spake manie reprochfull words of the couetousnesse vsed in

<p class="nogap">Bicause they had receiued seauen hundred marks for the consecration of
the bishop of Mauns, and 1500. marks for the confirming of the bishop of
Elie the popes legat. And againe no small summe of monie they had
receiued of the archbishop of Burdeaux, when vpon an accusation brought
against him by the cleargie of his prouince he should haue b&eacute;ene
deposed. In the meane time whiles king Richard thus passed forward
towards Messina, the nauie that was appointed to coast about Spaine and
to m&eacute;et him at Marseilles, was tossed (as before is said) with wind and
tempests, and a part thereof, that is, to wit, ten ships driuen here and
there on the coasts of Spaine, of which number nine arriued at Lisbone
and the tenth being a ship of London arriued at the citie of Sylua,
which was then the vttermost citie of Spaine, that was inhabited with
christians.</p>

<p>The Saracens at that time made warres against the king of Portingale, so
that the Portingales stood in n&eacute;ed of aid, in so much that they of Sylua
did not onelie intreat the Englishmen to staie with them for a time, but
also got grant of them to breake their ship, with the timber whereof
they might the better fortifie their towne, promising that their king
should recompense them with an other as good as theirs, and also further
satisfie them for their seruice, during the time of their abode therein
defense of that citie. Likewise of those that arriued at Lisbone there
went to the number of fiue hundred vnto saint Iranes, where the king of
<span class="rightnote">The king of Portingale.</span>
Portingale then was, looking to be assaulted by his enimies: but by the
counterfet<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> death of the great K. of the Saracens named Boiac
<span class="rightnote">Almiramumoli king of the Saracens.</span>
Almiramumoli (who feared these new succours, and doubted the sequele of
his dooings, to the end he might depart with honour, he fained himselfe
dead) the king of Portingale was for that time presentlie deliuered out
of danger.</p>

<p>Herevpon he returned to Lisbone, where he found three score and thr&eacute;e
other ships of king Richards nauie there newlie arriued, ouer the which
<span class="rightnote">Robert de Sabuuille. Richard de Camuille.</span>
were ch&eacute;efe capteins Robert de Sabuuille, and Richard de Camuille: which
at their comming to land could not so gouerne their people, but that
some naughtie fellowes amongst them fell to breaking and robbing of
orchards: some also entring into the citie, behaued themselues verie
disorderlie. But yet by the comming of the king, their lewdnesse was
staied; so that he seemed not to s&eacute;eke reuenge of the pilgrims, but
rather with courteous meanes to bridle their vnlawfull attempts:
wherevnto the diligence of the English capteines not a little preuailed
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" ></a><span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
for a while, but yet for all that could be done on both sides, within
three daies after, a new tumult was raised betwixt the English pilgrims
and the townesmen, and diuerse hurt and killed on either part.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A mutinie betwixt the Englishmen and the townsmen of
Lisbone.<br />
Englishmen committed to prison.</span>
Wherevpon the king caused the gates of the citie to be shut, and all
those that were come from the ships into the citie to eat and drinke
(being in number about seauen hundred) were apprehended and committed to
ward: and before they could be released, sir Robert Sabuuille and sir
Richard Camuille were glad to agree with the king, so as all former
offenses being remitted, and things taken by either part restored, the
Englishmen promised to obserue the peace against the king of Portingale
and his people; and he likewise couenanted for him and his subiects,
that they should k&eacute;epe the peace against all pilgrims that went foorth
in this voiage, and vse them like his fr&eacute;ends, and thus the quarell
ceased.</p>

<p>Soone after, the English nauie departed from Lisbone, and came into the
mouth of the riuer of Taie, betw&eacute;ene Caperico and Belem, where the same
daie on saint James &eacute;eue the lord William de Forzdulerun arriued also
with thr&eacute;e and thirtie other ships, and so then they were in all about
<span class="rightnote">The English ships m&eacute;et togither.</span>
an hundred and six sailes verie well furnished and manned, and so from
thence taking their course towards Marseilles, finallie they arriued
there in the octaues of the assumption of our ladie; and staieng there
an eight daies (till they had repaired such things about their ships as
were n&eacute;edfull) they set forward againe, and came to Messina in Sicile in
the feast of the exaltation of the crosse. On the sunday following also
came the French king thither, hauing lost no small part of his nauie by
tempests of weather.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">They arriue at Messina.</span>
King Richard as then remained at Salern, and hearing that his nauie was
gone towards Messina, he departed thence on the thirteenth day of
September, and hasted forth towards Messina, passing by Melphi and
Cocenza, and so at length comming to Faro de Messina, he passed the
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard arriueth at Messina.</span>
same, and on the 23. day of September arriued at Messina with great
noise of trumpets and other instruments, to the woonder of the French
king and others that beheld his great puissance and roiall behauiour now
at this comming. The same time he went vnto the French kings lodging, to
commen with him of their businesse: and immediatlie the French king
tooke the sea, in purpose to haue passed forward on his iournie but by
contrarie wind he was staied and kept backe within the hauen, wherevpon
both the kings determined to winter there, and in the meane time to
prouide themselues of alle things necessarie for their iournie, against
the beginning of the next spring. On the 30. of September he receiued
his sister the qu&eacute;ene of Sicile, the widow of William the late king of
that Ile, whom he placed in a strong fortresse, which he tooke the same
day and left therein a conuenient garison of men of armes and demilances
for the safegard of the place and of his said sister.</p>

<p>&para; But now for the better vnderstanding of the cause of such quarelling
as fell out betwixt the Englishmen and the Sicilians, y&eacute;e shall
vnderstand that a little before the arriuall of the kings of England and
France in those parts, king William of Sicile was departed this life,
leauing no issue behind him. Wherevpon the lords of the Ile elected one
Tancred to their king, a bastard sonne of Roger sometime king of that
land, and grandfather to this last decessed king William. This Tancred
though he receiued king Richard verie courteouslie; yet he greatlie
trusted him not, bicause he demanded the dowrie of his sister qu&eacute;ene
Joane, wife to the late king William to be restored, whereas he had not
readie monie to discharge it.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A chaire of gold.</span>
Furthermore to depart with the citie of Mount saint Angelo; with all the
countrie therevnto belonging; which was ind&eacute;ed assigned to hir for hir
dowrie, he thought in no wise profitable: but king Richard did not

onelie require that citie and countie with a chaire of gold, according
to the custome of that kingdome in right of his sister, as due to hir by
way of hir dowrie, but also he required to his owne vse a table of gold
conteining twelue foot in length, and one foot and a halfe in breadth, &amp;
two tressels of gold to
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" ></a><span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
beare vp the same table, with 24. siluer cups,
and as manie dishes of siluer, with a tent of silke of such largenesse
that two hundred knights might sit at meat within it: also fortie
thousand measures of wheat, with as manie of barlie, and as manie of
wine, beside one hundred armed gallies, with all furniture and vittels
sufficient to serue the gallie-men in the same for the terme of two
yeares. These things he demanded as due to him being heire to his father
king Henrie, accordinglie as was deuised by king William in his last
will and testament, which demands seemed intollerable to the said
Tancred: so that if he could haue shifted the matter, he was loth to
haue heard thereof.</p>

<p>Moreouer, bicause pope Clement in right of the church pretended a title
to the realme of Sicile, now that king William was dead without heires,
he doubted of some practise that might be made against him betwixt king
Richard and the pope. Wherevpon he thought to prouide against all
attempts that might be made, fortifieng his townes &amp; castels with strong
garisons, and tooke counsell with the citizens of Messina, by what
meanes he might soonest dispatch his countrie of that present danger,
and procure K. Richard to get him forward on his iournie.</p>

<p>Whilest these things were in hand, there was ministred to the English
men occasion of displeasure: for as it oftentimes chanceth (where an
armie is) certeine of the vnrulie souldiers within Messina vsed
themselues somewhat riotouslie, wherevpon the citizens offended
therewith, got them to armour, and chased all the souldiers out of the
citie. King Richard who laie in campe without the walles n&eacute;ere to the
citie, was so highlie displeased herewith, that he caused his men to
arme themselues, and to prepare ladders and other necessarie things to
assault the citie: but by the mediation of the French king &amp; curteous
excuse of king Tancred (alledging the fault to rest onelie in a sort of
rude citizens, whome he promised to punish) the matter was taken vp, and
staied for a time, till at length it was perceiued, that the Sicilians
subtilie went about to feed king Richard with faire words, till he
should be readie to set forwards on his iournie, and so should the
matter passe without further punishment.</p>

<p>Herevpon king Richard, not minding to be so mocked at their hands,
approched one daie to the wals and gates with his armie in good araie of
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard assalteth and entreth the citie by force.</span>
battell to giue the assault, which was doone so earnestlie, and so well
mainteined, that finallie the citie was entred by force, and manie of
the citizens slaine, but the slaughter had b&eacute;ene much greater, if king
Richard had not commanded his men to spare the sword, mooued with the
lamentable noise of poore people crieng to him for mercie and grace. The
Englishmen hauing got possession of the citie pight vp the banners with
the armes of the king of England round about the wals, wherewith the
French king was sore displeased, and required that the same might be
taken downe, and his set vp: but the king of England would not so agr&eacute;e.
Neuerthelesse to pacifie the French kings mood, he deliuered the citie
of Messina into the custodie of the knights Templers and Hospitalers,
till he might be satisfied of such things as he demanded of king
Tancred.</p>

<p>After this on the 8. daie of October, the two kings of England and
France, before a great number of earles, barons, and others, both of the
<span class="rightnote">The two kings of England and France receiue a solemne oth.</span>
cleargie and temporaltie, tooke their solemne othes, that the one should
defend the other, and also either others armie in this iournie, both
comming and going, without fraud or deceipt: and the like oth was
receiued by the earles and barons on both parties. Then the two kings by
aduise and consent of both their armies deuised these ordinances.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Ordinances deuised.</span>
1 That all pilgrims which chanced to die in this iournie might dispose

they lost aboue that summe: the persons aforenamed to haue the same to

their seruants in their presence likewise to plaie, so that they
exc&eacute;eded not the summe of 20 shillings. And also the seruants of
archbishops, bishops, earles and barons, by their maisters commandement
might play, not exc&eacute;eding that summe: but if anie seruants or mariners,
or other of like degr&eacute;e, were found to play without licence, the
seruants should be whipped naked three daies round about the campe,
except they ransomed foorth themselues, at the pleasure of the persons
aboue named: and the mariners should be plunged ouer head and eares in

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
But to returne now to the dissention betwixt the Englishmen
and them of Messina: ye shall vnderstand that the tumult being once
ceassed, and diuerse of the ch&eacute;efe offenders in the late commotion put
to death, king Tancred shortlie after came thither, and sought to auoid
all suspicion out of king Richards head, that he might conceiue of him
for b&eacute;eing in anie wise culpable in that which his subiects of Messina
had attempted against him, and therefore hauing recouered monie of his
freends, he restored vnto king Richard the dowrie of his sister qu&eacute;ene
Joane, and further offered vnto him to ioine in new alliance with him,
offering his daughter in mariage vnto Arthur duke of Britaine, the kings
nephue, with a great summe of monie for hir dowrie, if it so should
please him.</p>

<p>King Richard accepted the offer, and so ioined in peace and affinitie
with the king of Sicile, receiuing of him twentie thousand ounces of
gold for the same mariage to be had, and an honorable dowrie assigned
foorth of the lands that belonged to the said Arthur for the said ladie
to inioy during hir life, in case she suruiued hir husband. And if it so
chanced, that by the death of either of them the mariage could not take
place, then
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" ></a><span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
should king Richard restore the same twentie thousand
ounces of gold againe. But beside these twentie thousand ounces of gold
thus giuen by king Tancred for the mariage of his daughter, he gaue
other twentie thousand ounces to king Richard for an acquitance and
quite claime of all manner of duties, rights, and demands, which either
he or his sister might pretend, either by reason of anie bequest,
dowrie, or anie other manner of waie.</p>

<p>Here is to be noted, that before this conclusion of peace was had, king
Richard prouided for his owne defense, in case that king Tancred and his
people would haue attempted force against him, in so much that he
fortified certeine places, and built a strong castell aloft vpon the top
of an hill fast by Messina, which castell he called Mategriffon. Also
whereas the admirall of Sicile called Margaret, and one Jordane del
Poine, men of great authoritie vnder king Tancred, fled out of Messina
with all their families and riches, which they had either in gold or
siluer, king Richard seized vpon their houses, their gallies, and
possessions, so that he made himselfe as strong as he could, to resist
all attempts that might be made against him by his enimies. But now to
proc&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>The variance being thus appeased betwixt them, great discord chanced to
arise betwixt king Richard and king Philip, who was much offended with
king Richard, for that he had thus vsed violence against them of
Messina, and compelled king Tancred to agr&eacute;e with him for monie, to the
<span class="rightnote">The lawes of Herberrough.</span>
great offense and breach of the lawes of Herberrough, sith the Sicilians
verie liberallie aided and furnished the christians armie with vittels
and necessarie prouisions. The Frenchmen also had much enuie thereat,
<span class="rightnote">Englishmen and Frenchmen fought.</span>
that shortlie after vpon a small occasion they picked a quarell against
the Englishmen, and from words fell to strokes on both sides, so that
there had beene much hurt &amp; slaughter committed, if the two kings had
<span class="rightnote">Discord in an armie the hinderer of all profitable enterprises.</span>
not doone their best to appease the fraie begun.</p>

<p>But this businesse though it was quietlie as then taken vp and staied,
yet bred it such displeasure betwixt the princes and their people, that
it turned to the great hurt and hinderance of their good proceedings in
their whole enterprise, so that the occasion of a full and perfect
victorie easilie slipped out of their hands, as you shall heare
hereafter.</p>

<p>An other also of the ch&eacute;efest causes of grudge betwixt the two kings
was, for that king Richard in familiar talke confessed vnto king Philip,
that he would marie the king of Nauarres daughter, and cl&eacute;erelie forsake
his sister Adela: which gr&eacute;eued king Philip not a little, though he
dissembled the matter for a time, and rather alledged other causes of
displeasure, wherewith to defame king Richard to the world, as one that
sought his owne commoditie in spoiling those whom he ought rather to
haue defended. But to proceed.</p>

<p>Whilest the English and French armies thus soiourned all the winter time
in Sicile, notwithstanding the troubles aforesaid, to the hinderance of
king Richards purposes, for the making of his prouisions readie for his
iournie, he yet caused engins to be framed, his ships to be newlie
calked, rigged and repaired of such hurts as they had receiued both in
their long voiage which they had made, and also by certeine wormes, the
which during their lieng there, had in diuerse places gnawne and eaten
them through to the great danger of their losse, and vtter decaie.
<span class="rightnote">Wreckes pardoned.</span>
Moreouer at the same time he pardoned all wrecks by sea through all his
dominions, releasing for euer all his right to the same, in such wise
that euerie person making wrecke by sea, and comming aliue to land,
should haue all his goods fr&eacute;e and cleare to himselfe. Furthermore he
decr&eacute;ed, that if he chanced to perish in the ship, then his sons and
daughters, brethren or sisters, that could prooue themselues to be next
heires to him, should haue the same goods; but if he had neither sonne
nor daughter, brother nor sister, then should the king haue those goods
by waie of his prerogatiue.</p>

<p>This resignation made by king Richard, was confirmed by his charter
giuen at Messina in the moneth of October and second yeare of his
reigne. Also vpon a godlie
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219" ></a><span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
repentance wherewith it did please the
mercifull God to touch his hart, he called all those prelats togither
which were then with him at Messina into the chappell of Reginald de
<span class="rightnote">K. Richards confession.</span>
Moiac, &amp; there in presence of them all falling downe vpon his knees he
confessed the filthie life which he had in lecherous lust before that
time led, and humblie receiued penance inioined him by the same bishops,
and so became a new man, fearing God, and delighting to liue after his
lawes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Abbat Joachim.</span>
Furthermore hearing of the great fame of abbat Joachim, he sent for him
ouer into Calabria, who came to Messina, and being asked sundrie
questions by king Richard, he made woonderfull answer thereto: as in
Houeden and other writers it may app&eacute;ere, which for breefenesse I passe
ouer. About the same time he gaue vnto his nephue Otho, the sonne of his
sister Maud, sometime duchesse of Saxonie, the countie of Yorke. But
although some were contented to receiue him as their lord, and to doo
homage to him, yet other refused him, alledging that they would not
renounce their fealties due to the king, till they might s&eacute;e him againe,
&amp; talke with him face to face. Wherevpon the king changing his purpose,
gaue vnto the said Otho the countie of Poictou in steed of the said
countie of Yorke, as after shall appeere.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1191.</span>
The two kings of England and France held their Christmasse this yeare at
Messina, and still the king of England vsed great liberalitie in
bestowing his treasure freelie amongst knights and other men of warre,
<span class="rightnote">The large expenses of K. Richard.</span>
so that it was thought he spent more in a moneth than anie of his
predecessours euer spent in a whole yeare. In the moneth of Februarie he
sent his gallies to Naples, there to receiue his mother and his wife
that should be, to wit the ladie Berengaria daughter to the king of
Nauarre, and Philip earle of Flanders that came with them. But his
mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor and the ladie Berengaria went to Brindize in
Puglia, where they were honorablie receiued of Margaret king Tancreds
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Flanders.</span>
admirall. Moreouer the earle of Flanders comming to Naples, and finding
there the gallies of king Richard, went aboord the same, and so came to
Messina, at the first following the king of England in all things, till
the French king hauing enuie thereat, allured him awaie, and then he
hoong altogither on his sl&eacute;eue. The first daie of March the king of
England departed from Messina, to go to the citie of Cathina, there to
common with king Tancred, who came thither to meet him.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard talketh with king Tancred.</span>
Here king Richard vnderstood, that the French king had sollicited king
Tancred to set vpon the king of England and his armie, to chase them out
of his realme: and for the more easie accomplishment thereof, he had
promised him his aid, whensoeuer he would giue the aduenture. King
Tancred deliuered also to king Richard such letters as the French king
had written to him concerning this matter. Wherevpon at his returne to
Messina, king Richard shewed by his frowning countenance, that he was
nothing pleased with the French king, but sought occasions to get him
out of his companie.</p>

<p>The French king perceiuing it, required to vnderstand the cause of this
sudden mutation: wherevpon king Richard nothing fearing his power,
declared the truth plainelie vnto him by the mouth of the earle of
Flanders: and when the other denied the practise, he for proofe of the
thing, shewed him the same letters which king Tancred had deliuered vnto
him. The French king was not a little abashed hereat, and wist not well
what to saie, nor what excuse to make, the matter was so plaine. But yet
at length he said: "Well now I perceiue the king of England seeketh to
haue some quarell whie he may refuse to marrie with my sister. For these
are but forged matters, and no truth resteth in them."</p>

<p>When the king of England vnderstood this maner of answer, he replied in
this wise; "That as for the French kings sister, he might not marrie,
for as much as he was able to produce good witnesse to prooue that his
father had lien with hir and got a child of hir. And as for his priuie
proc&eacute;eding and practise with Tancred, he n&eacute;eded no further testimonie
than his owne hand and his seale, the partie himselfe being present
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" ></a><span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
who
receiued them, the messenger also being not far off that carried them
betw&eacute;ene both the parties."</p>

<p>When the French king was throughlie informed of the first point, through
counsell of the earle of Flanders and others, he pacified himselfe, and
was contented to release the king of England of his faith giuen by oth
for the contract made with his sister Alice: in consideration of which
releasement and deliuerance, the king of England couenanted to giue
yearelie to the French king two thousand marks of starling coine for the
terme of fiue yeares togither: and at his returne home, it was agreed,
that he shuld also deliuer vnto the French king his sister the said
ladie Alice, with the towne of Gisors, and all other things which the
French king had granted to him with his said sister. On the other part,
the French king granted, that the dutchie of Britaine should apperteine
to the dominion of the dutchie of Normandie, so as the duke of Britaine
should be accompted the liege man of the duke of Normandie, and that the
duke of Normandie should answer the French king for both the dutchies,
as well of Britaine as Normandie. These agr&eacute;ements were ratified and
confirmed with solemne oths receiued, and charters giuen vnder their
hands and seales, vpon the 30. of March.</p>

<span class="rightnote">The French king setteth foorth from Messina towards the holie<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
land.</span>
About this time the French king (now that the season of the yeare was
come) set forward toward the holie land, leauing king Richard behind him
in Sicile: and the two and twentith day after his setting foorth from
Messina, he arriued at the siege of Acres or Acon. The same day also
that the French king departed from Messina, queene Elianor the mother of
king Richard arriued there, bringing with hir the ladie Berengaria the
daughter of Sanctius the king of Nauarre, and the fourth day after
<span class="rightnote">Qu&eacute;ene Elianor returneth by Rome.</span>

confirme and consecrate him archbishop, or to authorise some other to
doo it in his name. The ladie Berengaria remained behind with the kings
sister Joane qu&eacute;ene of Sicile.</p>

<p>After this in the moneth of Aprill, on the Wednesday in the passion
weeke, king Richard (after he had finished and made an end of all
conclusions with king Tancred) did also set forward with his sister
Joane, who tooke with hir the ladie Berengaria daughter to the king of
Nauarre, affianced to him long before, as aboue is partlie mentioned.
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> 130. ships and 53. galies saith
<i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
His nauie consisted in thirteene mightie great ships with triple sailes,
an hundred carikes or rather hulkes, and fiftie gallies. He was no
sooner abroad in the maine sea, but a great tempest arose, wherewith his
whole nauie was sore tossed and turmoiled vp and downe the seas, and at
length driuen on the coast of Cypres, where s&eacute;eking to take harbour, &amp;
to come on land, the Cypriots would not suffer him, but shewed
countenance to driue him backe, and to resist his landing. Also whereas
six of his ships were so driuen by force of tempest from the residue,
that thr&eacute;e of them perished, and three being cast vpon the shoare of
Cypres before the kings arriuall there, the souldiers and other people
in the same were compelled to come on land for sauing their liues, where
otherwise they stood in danger of drowning, the people of the Ile
assailing them in right cruell sort, slue diuerse, and tooke the residue
prisoners, and so deteined them for a certeine season.</p>

<p>King Richard then vnderstanding this iniurie to him doone by the
Cypriots, &amp; perceiuing they would resist his landing, prepared himselfe
and his people to enter vpon them by force. The king of Cypres Isakius
or Cursach (whome Houeden nameth emperour of Cypres) had assembled the
most part of all the power of men that he might make (though few of them
were armed, or had any great skill in feats of warre) and caused them to
set boords, logs of wood, benches, formes, and great chests afore them,
as a defense, and as it were in steed of a wall, that by succour thereof
they might the better k&eacute;epe off their enimie from landing.</p>

<p>But K. Richard, so incouraged his men by his presence, &amp; hartened them
with such
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" ></a><span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
comfortable words as he vttered vnto them, that rowing to the
shoare with their galies and small botes, hauing the archers afore them,
<span class="rightnote">The Englishmen take land &amp; chase their enimies.</span>
they easilie got to land, droue their enimies backe, and so farre
pursued them (being but footmen, weatherbeaten, wearie, and weat) as
conuenientlie they might, for the shortnes of time. King Richard hauing
thus got foot on land, approched the towne of Limezun, which he with his
souldiers entred, and finding it emptie of people (which were fled
awaie) but full of riches and great plentie of victuals, as corne, wine,
oile, and flesh, he seized therevpon.</p>

<p>The same day also the kings sisters and the ladie Berengaria with the
residue of the kings nauie entred the hauen of Limezun. In the meane
time the king of Cypres (hauing escaped from the battell) got togither
his men which were fled and dispersed sundrie waies, and incamped within
six miles of king Richard, threatning that the next day he would
eftsoones giue battell: which when king Richard vnderstood, he caused
his people to be armed the next morning long before day, and so comming
by guides vnto the place where the Cypriots with their king were lodged,
<span class="rightnote">King Richard with a camisado vanquisheth the Cypriots, &amp;
chaseth them out of their campe. <i>Iohn&nbsp;Textor.</i></span>
suddenlie they assailed them yer they had anie warning of his marching
towards them, by reason whereof they were slaine like beasts in great
numbers. Howbeit, their king and a few other escaped and fled away
naked, hauing no time to put on their apparell, his treasure, horsse,
armour and standard were taken, which standard king Richard straitwaies
determined to send vnto saint Edmunds shrine, and so did.</p>

<p>Having thus vanquished his aduersaries, he came backe to Limezun: and
the third day after, Guie king of Jerusalem and his brother Geffrey de
<span class="rightnote">The K. of Jerusalem and other noble men doo fealtie vnto king

Lucignan with the prince of Antioch Raimond and his sonne named also
Raimond earle of Tripoli, with other noble men, arriued at Limezun
aforesaid, to visit king Richard, and to offer him their seruices, and
so became his men, in swearing fealtie to him against all other persons
whatsoeuer.</p>

<p>The same day the king of Cypres perceiuing himselfe vnable to resist the
great puissance of king Richards armie, sent ambassadours, and offered
to king Richard the summe of twentie thousand marks of gold, in
<span class="rightnote">The offers of the king of Cypres.</span>
recompense of the monie which his men that were drowned had about them,
and also to restore those to libertie which he had taken prisoners, and
to make deliuerie to their hands of all their goods. Furthermore he
offered to go with him into the holie land personallie, and to serue him
with an hundred knights 400 light horssemen, and 500 well armed footmen,
<span class="rightnote">The king of Cypres submitteth himselfe.</span>
&amp; also to deliuer to king Richard his daughter and heire in hostage, and
to acknowledge him his souereigne lord, by swearing to him fealtie for
his kingdome, as for that which he should confesse to hold of him.</p>

<p>King Richard accepted these offers, and so the king of Cypres came in
and sware fealtie to king Richard, in presence of the king of Jerusalem,
the prince of Antioch, and other barons, and promised vpon his oth then
receiued, not to depart till all things couenanted on his part were
performed. Then king Richard assigned tents for him and his to lodge in,
and appointed certeine knights and other men of warre to haue the
custodie of him. But the same day after dinner vpon repentance of that
which he had doone, he deceiued his keepers and stale awaie, sending
knowledge backe to the king that he would not stand to the couenants,
which were concluded vpon betwixt them.</p>

<p>King Richard seemed to like the matter well enough, and foorthwith
deliuered a part of his armie vnto the king of Jerusalem and to the
prince of Antioch, appointing them to persue the king of Cypres by land,
whilest he with one part of his gallies and Robert de Turneham with the
other might search about the coast by sea, to prohibit his passage by
water. In euerie place where they came, such ships and gallies as they
found they seized into their hands, and no resistance was made against
them, by reason the people fled to the woods and mountains, leauing the
cities, townes and castels void in all st&eacute;eds, where the king or the
<span class="rightnote">Robert de Turneham.</span>
said sir Robert de Turneham with their vessels began to
app&eacute;ere.

When
they had taken their pleasure thus alongst the coasts, they returned
againe vnto Limezun. The king of Jerusalem and the other that went
foorth by land, when they could not sp&eacute;ed of their purpose, returned
also, in which meane time a great number of Cypriots came in, and
submitting themselues to king Richard, were receiued as his subiects.</p>

<p>On the 12. daie of Maie, the ladie Berengaria daughter to the king of
<span class="rightnote">The king of England marieth the ladie Berengaria. She is
crowned qu&eacute;ene.</span>
Nauarre was maried according to a precontract vnto king Richard at
Limezun aforesaid in the Ile of Cypres, one of the kings chaplins
executing the order of the marriage. The same daie also she was crowned
by the bishop of Eureux, the archbishops of Apamea and Aux, with the
bishop of Baion ministring vnto him. After the solemnitie of this
marriage and coronation ended, king Richard set forward with his armie
into the countrie of Cypres, and first wan (by surrender) the citie of
Nichosia, and after the strong castell of Cherin, within the which was
the daughter of the king of Cypres, which ladie humblie yeelded hir
selfe vnto K. Richard, (who counting it reproach to be extreme with such
as submit themselues, and speciallie the female sex, according to the
old saieng,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pacere subiectis nobilis scit ira leonis)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="nogap">had pitie of hir case, and sent hir to his wife the new qu&eacute;ene, willing
that she might be honorablie vsed. From thence passing forward, these
<span class="rightnote">Castels deliuered to the king of England.</span>
castels were deliuered into his hands, Baffes and Buffeuent, Den, Amur,
Candace, and afterwards all the other castels and cities, townes and
places of strength within that Ile one after an other. Finallie, hearing
<span class="rightnote">The king of Cyprus again submitteth himselfe to the king of
England.</span>
that the king of Cypres was inclosed in an abbie called Cap S. Andrew,
he marched thitherwards: but when the king of Cypres heard of his
approch, he came foorth and submitted himselfe wholie into his hands.
The king first appointed him to the k&eacute;eping of his chamberlaine Rafe
<span class="rightnote">Rafe Fitz Geffrey.</span>
Fitz Geffrey, and after sent him into the citie of Tripoli, there to be
kept in close prison. Who when he heard he should be committed to close
prison, and remaine in fetters, said, "that if he laie in irons, he
should shortlie end his life." Wherevnto king Richard when he heard of
it, answered: "He saith well, and therefore bicause he is a noble man,
and our mind is not to haue him dead, but onelie to be kept safe from
starting anie more awaie, and dooing new hurt, let him be chained in
giues and fetters made of siluer," and so he was.</p>

<p>But to proc&eacute;ed. After the king had set the countrie of Cypres in good
staie, he deliuered the keeping thereof vnto Richard de Camuille and
<span class="rightnote">He arriued there on the saturdaie in Whitsunw&eacute;ek, being the
saturdaie also next before the feast of S. Barnabie. <i>Galfridus.</i>
<i>Vinsant.</i></span>
Robert de Turneham. This doone vpon the wednesdaie in the Whitsunw&eacute;eke
he tooke the sea againe, and passed ouer to the citie of Acres, which as
then was besieged by the christian armie, as ye may read in the
description of the holie land, onelie giuing you to vnderstand, that
such was the valiancie of king Richard shewed in manfull constreining of
the citie, that his praise was greatlie bruted both amongst the
christians and also the Saracens.</p>

<p>Howbeit the secret enimitie betwixt him and the French king eftsoones
reuiued, by occasion of such discord as chanced betwixt Guido king of
Jerusalem, and Conrade the marques of Tire, so that parties were taken,
and whereas both the Pisans and Geneuois did offer their seruice vnto
king Richard, yet bicause the Geneuois were confederat with the French
king, who tooke part with the marques, he refused them, and receiued the
<span class="rightnote">Pisans and Geneuois.</span>
Pisans, ioining himselfe with king Guido to support him against his
enimies.</p>

<p>Here is to be remembred, that before king Richard arriued at the siege,
he incountred on the sea a mightie great ship called a Drommond, which
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Nic.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> Saphaldine the brother
of Saladine.</span>
one Saphaldine the brother of Saladine a prince of the Saracens had
sent, to refresh them with vittels. This ship king Richard caused
f&eacute;ercelie to be assailed with his gallies, and at length bowged hir with
all the vittels and prouision within the same, as wild-fire, barels of
firie serpents, armour and weapons of sundrie sorts, besides all the
mariners and men of warre, except such as were taken to mercie and saued
aliue, being about 200 in the whole, whereas there were aboord the same
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
ship 500 men of warre, as some write, though other haue but 800.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" ></a><span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
&para; But now to other accidents that chanced this yere. On Midsummer eeue
there was such an eclipse of the sunne, the moone being the same time 27
<span class="rightnote">An eclipse of the sunne.</span>
daies old, that for the space of thr&eacute;e houres (for so long it lasted)
such darkness came ouer the face of the earth, that euen in the daie
<span class="rightnote">The seuenth houre of the daie saith <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
time (for this eclipse began about nine of the clocke in the morning)
the stars appeared plainelie in the element.</p>

<p>In the same moneth of June, Richard de Camuille, whome the king had left
(as ye haue heard) gouernour in Cypres, chanced to fall sicke, and
<span class="rightnote">Richard de Camuille deceasseth.</span>
comming without licence to the siege of Acres, there died. After whose
death the Cypriots and those called Griffones and Ermians reuolted from
the English obedience, and chose to them a king, one that was a moonke
of the familie of Isachus their former king: but Robert de Turneham, who
after the deceasse of Richard Camuille remained sole gouernour of the
Ile, gathered a power of men togither, and giuing battell to the new
king (whom Houeden nameth also emperour) vanquished him with his
complices, tooke him prisoner, and hanged him on a paire of galowes. The
same moneth also died Rafe Fitz Geffrey, who had the other king Isac in
custodie, and then king Richard deliuered him to the knights of the
hospitall, who sent him to the castell of Margant, there safelie to be
kept as prisoner to the vse of the king of England.</p>

<p>Now will we returne vnto the affaires of England and make some mention
of the dooings there. Yee shall vnderstand, that after king Richard was
set forward on his iournie, William Longchampe lord chancellour and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
bishop of Elie, appointed (as ye haue heard) gouernour of the realme,
began to exercise his authoritie to the vttermost, taking vpon him the
state of a prince, rather than of a subiect. He had of late (as before
ye haue heard) procured such fauor at the hands of pope Clement, that he
<span class="rightnote">The Lord chancellor called the popes legat in England.</span>
was instituted by him legat of the apostolike see here in England, so
that pretending a rule both ouer the clergie and temporaltie, and by
reason that he had both the authoritie of pope and king in his hands, he
vsed the same to his most aduantage, as well in causes ecclesiasticall
as temporall, whereby he wrought manie oppressions both against them of
<span class="rightnote">The statelie port of the lord chancellor. <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
the clergie and temporaltie. He mainteined such a port and countenance
in his dooings, that he would ride with a thousand horsses, by meanes
whereof when he came to lie at abbeis and other places (bringing with
him such a traine) he was verie burdenous vnto them, speciallie when he
laie at their houses any space of time.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A conuocation.</span>
This man called a conuocation at Westminster, wherein at the suit of
Hugh Nouant bishop of Chester, it was decreed, that the moonks of
<span class="rightnote">Moonks of Couentrie displaced. <i>Polydor.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i>
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> The occasion. <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i></span>
Couentrie should be displaced, and secular canons brought into that
house to supplie their roomes. Which was doone by the authoritie of the
said lord chancellour, being bribed by the foresaid bishop of Chester
(as some writers haue recorded) for displeasure which he bare to the
moonks, by reason of a fraie which they had made vpon the said bishop in
their church at Couentrie, and drawne bloud of him before the alter
there, as he alledged.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
But some haue written, that the bishop of Chester procured a licence of
the pope, to alter the state of that church in sort aboue mentioned,
which is most likelie, surmising against the moonks, that they were most
manifest and stubborne disturbers of that peace and quietnesse which
ought to remaine amongst churchmen: and yet he himselfe sowed the strife
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
and dissention amongst them, and namelie betw&eacute;ene the prior and his
couent. Moreouer, the said lord chancellour depriued such rulers of
their administrations and gouernements, as the king had appointed to
beare any high authoritie within the realme, pretending not onelie the
kings commandement, but also alleadging a reason which mooued him so to
doo, as thus, that he might thereby take awaie all occasions of grudges
from the people, which otherwise might thinke, and would not sticke to
<span class="rightnote">The L. chancellors reason.<br />
The bishop of Durham. <br />
The bishop of Winchester.</span>
saie, that they were oppressed by the rule of manie kings in st&eacute;ed of
one king. He did also depriue Hugh the bishop of Durham of all his
honour and dignitie, and put the bishop of Winchester to great trouble.
Moreouer, doubting least the Nobles of the realme would rise against
him, and put him out of his place; he sought to k&eacute;epe them lowe, and
spoiled
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" ></a><span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
them of their monie and substance. Likewise pretending a colour
<span class="rightnote">The lord chancellors meaning to k&eacute;epe earle John lowe.</span>
of doubt, least earle John the kings brother should attempt any thing
against his brother the king now in his absence, he sought also to k&eacute;epe
him vnder. To be br&eacute;efe, he plaied in all points the right part of a
tyrant, and shewed himselfe such a one in all respects as mainteined his
title,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>At length the king receiued aduertisement from his mother queene Elianor
of his demeanor, and that there was great likeliehood of some commotion
to insue, if sp&eacute;edie remedie were not in time prouided. Wherevpon being
<span class="rightnote">Walter the archbishop of Rouen sent into England.</span>
then in Sicile, he sent Walter the archbishop of Rouen into England with
commission, to ioine in administration of the kingdome with his
chancellor the said bishop of Elie. But the archbishop comming into
England was so slenderlie interteined of the chancellour, and in effect
so litle regarded, that notwithstanding his commission and instructions
<span class="rightnote">He is little regarded of the lord chancellor.</span>
brought from the king, he could not be permitted to beare any rule. But
the chancellour deteining the same wholie in his hands, ordered all
things at his pleasure, without making the archbish. of Rouen, or any
other of counsel with him, except such as it pleased him to admit for
the seruing of his owne turne.</p>

<p>&para; He certeinelie bel&eacute;eued (as manie other did) that king Richard would
neuer returne with life into England againe, which caused him to attempt
so manie vnlawfull enterprises, and therefore he got into his hands all
the castels and fortresses belonging to the crowne, and furnished them
with garisons of souldiers, as he thought necessarie, depriuing such
capteins of their roomes as he suspected not to fauour his proc&eacute;edings.</p>

<p>One Gerard de Camuille had bought of the king the k&eacute;eping of the castell
of Lincolne, vnto whome also the sheriffewike of the shire was committed
for a time, but the lord chancellour, perceiuing that he bare more good
will vnto earle John the kings brother than to him (which John he most
suspected) he tooke from him the shiriffewike, &amp; demanded also to haue
the castell of Lincolne deliuered into his hands, which Gerard refused
to deliuer, and perceiuing that the chancellor would practise to haue it
by force, he fled vnto earle John, requiring him of competent aid and
succour.</p>

<p>The chancellor on the other part, perceiuing what hatred diuerse of the
Nobles bare him, thought good to prouide for his owne suertie the best
that he could, and therefore sent for a power of men from beyond the
sea: but bicause he thought it too long to staie till they arriued, he
<span class="rightnote">The lord chancellor besiegeth the castell of Lincolne.<br />
Earle John winneth the castels of Notingham and Tickhill.</span>
came to Lincolne with such power as he could make, and besieged the
castell. Erle John the kings brother aduertised hereof, raised such
numbers of men as he might make of his freends, seruants and tenants,
and with small a doo wan the castels of Notingham and Tickhill within
two daies space. This doone, he sent to the lord chancellour, commanding
him either to breake vp his siege, or else to prepare for battell. The
chancellour considering with himselfe that there was small trust to be
put in diuerse of those lords that were with him, bearing good will to
<span class="rightnote">The chancellor raiseth his siege with dishonour.</span>
earle John, and but hollow harts towards him, raised his siege and
departed with dishonour.</p>

<p>Not long after, one of his hornes was broken off by the death of pope
Clement, whereby his power legantine ceased: wherewith being somewhat
<span class="rightnote">The lord chancellor and earle John are agr&eacute;ed.<br />
The chancellor breaketh the agr&eacute;ement.</span>
abashed, he came to a communication with earle John, and vpon certeine
conditions made peace with him. Shortlie after the souldiers which he
had sent for, arriued in England, and then he began to go from the
agr&eacute;ement made with earle John, affirming that he would either driue the
same earle out of England, or else should earle John doo the like to
him: for it was not of sufficient largenesse to hold them both. Howbeit,
shortlie after, a peace was eftsoones concluded betwixt them with
<span class="rightnote">The lord chancellor and earle John make another agr&eacute;ement.</span>
condition, that if it chanced king Richard to depart
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" ></a><span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
this life before
his returne into England, not leauing any issue of his bodie begotten,
that then the chancellour renouncing the ordinance made by king Richard
(who had instituted his nephue Arthur duke of Britaine to be his heire
and successour) should consent to admit earle John for king of England,
contrarie to the said ordinance.</p>

<p>But in the meane time it was agr&eacute;ed, that earle John should deliuer vp
the castels of Notingham and Tickhill, Notingham to the hands of William
Marshall, and Tickhill to the hands of William Wendenall, they to k&eacute;epe
the same vnto the vse and behoofe of king Richard, that vpon his returne
he might doo with them as should please him: prouided that if it so
chanced, that he should die before he could returne from his voiage, or
that the chancellour went from the agr&eacute;ement now taken, then immediatlie
should the foresaid castels of Notingham and Tickhill be restored vnto
earle John.</p>

<p>Moreouer, the other castels of such honours as were assigned to earle
John by the king his brother, were committed vnto the custodie of
certeine persons of great trust and loialtie, as the castell of
Wallingford to the archbishop of Rouen, the castell of Bristow to the
bishop of Lincolne, the castell of the Peake to the bishop of Couentrie,
the castell of Bolesofres vnto Richard de Peake (or if he refused, then
should the bishop of Couentrie haue it in k&eacute;eping) the castell Eie was
committed to Walter Fitz Robert, the castell of Herford to Roger Bigot,
and to Richard Reuell the castell of Excester and Launston. These
persons to whom these castels were thus committed to be kept, receiued
also an oth, that they should faithfullie k&eacute;epe them to the kings
behoofe, and if he chanced to die, before he should returne, then the
same should be deliuered vnto earle Johns hands. Also there were three
<span class="rightnote">Castels deliuered in trust to the keeping of certeine
persons.</span>
castels that perteined to the crowne, deliuered likewise in trust, as
the castell of Windsor vnto the earle of Arundell, the castell of
Winchester vnto Gilbert de Lacie, and the castell of Northampton vnto
Simon de Pateshull.</p>

<p>It was also agr&eacute;ed, that bishops, abbats, earles, and barons, valuasors,
and freeholders should not be disseised of their lands, goods or
chattels, otherwise than by order of the iustices or officers of the
king, so that they should be iudged in the kings courts according to the
lawfull customes and ordinances of the realme, and likewise that earle
John should cause the same orders to be obserued through all his lands.
Prouided that if any man attempted to doo otherwise vpon support or
maintenance of earle John, he should stand to be reformed by the
archbishop of Rouen if he chanced then to be in England, and by the
kings iustices, and by those that had sworne to obserue this peace: and
also earle John himselfe at their request should see such reformation to
be had.</p>

<p>Moreouer, it was agr&eacute;ed that all those castels that had bin built or
begun to be builded since the kings passage ouer towards his iournie,
should be razed, and no new made or fortified till his returne, except
in manours perteining to the kings demaine, if need required, or by his
speciall commandement, either by letters, or sufficient messengerrs.
That the shiriffewike of Lincolne, which the lord chancellour had
assigned vnto William de Stuteuille should be restored to Gerard de
Camuille, who had a daie appointed him to app&eacute;ere in the kings court, to
heare what might be laid against him: and if such matter could be
prooued, for the which he ought to loose the said shiriffewike and the
castell of Lincolne, then he should depart from them by the iudgement of
the court, or else not. Neither should earle John mainteine him against
the iudgement of that court, nor should receiue any outlawes, or such as
were notoriouslie knowen for enimies to the king, and so named, nor
should suffer them to be receiued within the precinct of his liberties.</p>

<p>To hold, mainteine and obserue this peace, the said earle and
chancellour sware in the hand of the archbishop of Rouen with seuen
barons on either part. On the part of earle John these were the names of
them that receiued the oth: Stephan Ridell his chancellour, William de
la Mare, Robert de la Mare, Philip de Turechester, William de Kahennes,
Gilbert Basset &amp; William de Montacute. On the chancellours part, the
earles of Arundell and Salisburie, earle Roger Bigot, and the earle of
Clare, with Walter Fitz
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" ></a><span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
Robert, William de Breuse, and Roger Fitz
Ramfrey. These things were concluded in this sort, the authoritie and
commandement of the king yet in all things saued and reserued: but so,
that if before his returne he should signifie his pleasure to the
contrarie of the ordinances aboue mentioned, then should the castels of
Notingham and Tickhill be restored vnto earle John, notwithstanding what
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;3.</span>
soeuer the king should command touching the same. Thus was the peace
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
concluded eftsoones betwixt earle John and the chancellour.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Geffrey the archbishop of Yorke. <i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
In this meane while, Geffrey the elect archbishop of Yorke, after long
suit and manie delaies contriued, speciallie by the chancellour,
obteined his pall, being consecrated by the archbishop of Towrs, by
virtue of his buls obteined from pope Celestine. The chancellour
aduertised herof, and vnderstanding that he meant to come shortlie into
England to be installed, was in a great chafe, bicause that during the
time of the vacation, he had vsed the reuenues of that see at his
pleasure, and therefore now to forego them he was nothing contented.
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Herevpon he wrote his letters vnto Matthew de Clare shiriffe of Kent in
this forme.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> The death of the archbishop of Canturbury.
<i>Io.&nbsp;Textor.</i></span>
Likewise, whereas Baldwine archbishop of Canturburie, hauing taken his
iournie into the holie land, and arriuing there before the king, chanced
to depart this life at Tyrus, the last yeere, vpon the feast daie of S.
Edmund, the chancellour found meanes to keepe that s&eacute;e also vacant, that
he might receiue the profits thereof, during the vacation, and find
meanes to be prepared to it in the end. But as touching the s&eacute;e of
Yorke, although he had (as before is said) made his hand of the reuenues
belonging to the same from time to time at his pleasure, yet now after
that he heard how Geffrey had receiued the pall, he made hauocke,
wasting &amp; spoiling all that would yeeld him anie monie, without respect
of right or wrong. Moreouer, he caused the hauens to be watched, with
commandement giuen to the townes on the sea coast, that they should not
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop arriued and is committed to ward.</span>
suffer the archbishop Geffrey to take land. At length yet he arriued at
Douer, where he was by the aforesaid Matthew de Clare first staied, and
after taken out of the abbeie by the chancellours commandement, and
committed to prison within the castell, where a Noble man that had
maried the chancellors sister was capteine.</p>

<p>The newes of whose imprisonment was anon bruted through the realme,
wherewith the Nobles fretted, and the commons curssed: finallie all men
detested such tyrannie in the chancellour. But namelie the kings brother
earle John stormed at the matter, and with all sp&eacute;ed assembled an armie
out of those places where he bare rule, increasing the number with a
power of Welshmen. There came to him the bishop of Winchester, with
manie earles and barons, also the bishop of Bath and Chester, which
latelie before had b&eacute;ene ch&eacute;efe fauourers of the chancellour in all his
dooings: but now that the world was
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" ></a><span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
changed, they shewed themselues the
most earnest enimies he had, as well in words as d&eacute;eds.</p>

<p>In an assemblie of all the bishops of England, all those were
excommunicate in solemne wise, with candels light, and other such
ceremonies, which had either giuen commandement, or were present as
partakers, to pull out of the church the archbishop of Yorke, or his
people by violence, and had imprisoned them in maner (as before y&eacute;e haue
heard:) but this was after the archbishop was set at libertie, as shuld
appeare by Matthew Paris, for the chancellour repenting himselfe (though
now too late) of his cruell dealing against the archbishop of Yorke,
wherewith he had kindled such a brand against him, commanded the said
archbishop (namelie at the instant sute of the bishop of London, or
rather at the commandement of earle John, as Houeden saith) to be set at
libertie. But the displeasure once kindled in the hearts of the Nobles,
could not so easilie<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> be quenched with his deliuerie, as it was sp&eacute;edilie
set on fire by his imprisonment, so that they being now in armour,
purposed to abate the pride of the chancellour, and to deliuer the
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The chancellour summoned to appeare.</span>
common-wealth, of such an vglie tyrant. And to begin, they summoned, and
assigned him a peremptorie day to appeare at Reading, to make answer
vnto such iniuaries as he had doone against the archbishop of Yorke, and
the bishop of Durham, sithens the departure of his souereigne lord the
king.</p>

<p>At which day there came to Reading earle John, and the archbishop of
Rouen, with manie other bishops, earles, and barons, abiding there all
that day, to s&eacute;e if the chancellour would appeare or no; but he came
not: wherevpon they prepared to march foorth towards London, and
therewithall set forward in like maner. He on the other side being a man
of a great courage, had gathered an armie of such strangers and other
his fr&eacute;ends as he could make, and therewith went foorth, and encamped
n&eacute;ere to Windsor, there to abide his aduersaries, and to giue them
battell, if they came forward and would abide it. But when they
approched, and he perceiued also how diuerse of his freends shranke from
him, and went to his enimies, he durst not attempt the hazard of a
<span class="rightnote">The chauncellour retireth to London.</span>
field, but fled backe to London, and there withdrew into the tower, with
all his host, bicause he durst not commit himselfe to the doubtfull
fellowship of the citizens. Through his great pride and statelie port
which he mainteined, as partlie y&eacute;e haue heard, he had procured to
himselfe no small hatred amongst all degrees of men, and namelie such as
by the kings appointment ought to haue beene parteners with him in
gouernement of the realme sore repined at his presumptuous proceedings,
for that he disdained (as it s&eacute;emed) to vse their aduise, or to ioine
them with him in the administration of things, so that now in time of
his trouble he wist not in whome he might put his trust.</p>

<p>After he was thus retired into the tower of London, earle John, the
archbishop of Rouen, and the other bishops, earles, and barons
associated togither against him, followed him at the h&eacute;eles, entered the
citie, and besieged the tower on ech side. On the morrow after, being
the fourth day after the octaues of saint Michaell, they came togither
into Paules church-yard, where they publikelie declared the iniurious
<span class="rightnote">A declaration made against the lord chancellour.</span>
wrongs doone and practised by the chancellour; namelie against the
archbishop of Yorke, and the bishop of Durham. Those also that had b&eacute;ene
appointed as associats with him, accused him, in that he had taken vpon
him to rule and gouerne all things after his owne will, not vouchsafing
to haue their aduise or councell in such sort as had b&eacute;ene conuenient.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Rouen and William Marshall earle of Pembroke shewed
there before all the people the kings letters which he had sent from
<span class="rightnote">The tenor of this letter shall h&eacute;ereafter appeare.</span>
Messina, appointing that they should be associats with him in gouernment
of the kingdome; and that without the counsell and aduice of them and
others assigned thereto, he should not meddle with the rule of the land,
and that if he should doo any thing to the hinderance of the
common-wealth, or s&eacute;eke to meddle with the affaires of the realme,
without their good aduise, that then he should be deposed. H&eacute;erevpon it
seemed good to earle John, and to all the bishops, earles and barons of
the realme, and to the citizens of London, there assembled, that the
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" ></a><span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
said chancellour should be deposed, and so they proceeded, and deposed
him in d&eacute;ed, appointing the archbishop of Rouen in his place, who would
not take vpon him to doo anie thing touching the rule of the land,
without consent of his associats assigned to him, and the barons or the
eschecker.</p>

<p>The same day, earle John, and the archbishop of Rouen, and other of the
<span class="rightnote">The citizens of London.</span>
kings iustices, granted to the citizens of London the priuilege of their
communaltie; and the said earle and archbishop, and in maner all the
bishops, erls and barons of the realme sware to mainteine the said
priuilege firme and stable, so long as should please their souereigne
lord. And the citizens of London sware to be true, and to doo their
faithfull seruice vnto king Richard and his heirs, and if he chanced to
die without issue, then to receiue earle John the brother of king
Richard for their king and souereigne lord, and therevpon sware fealtie
to him against all men, sauing that which they owed vnto his brother
king Richard.</p>

<p>The chancellour perceiuing the multitude to be such which he had with
him in the tower, as the place was not able to hold them any long time,
<span class="rightnote">The chancellour y&eacute;eldeth vp the tower.</span>
after he had remained within it one night, he came foorth vnto earle
John, and to the other that were thus entred the citie, and now readie
to besiege him, of whome he got licence for them that were inclosed
within the tower, to depart without damage, and therewith deliuered vp
the tower into the hands of the archbishop of Rouen, with the castell of
Windsor, and certeine other castels, which he held within the realme,
but not all: notwithstanding he couenanted to make deliuerie of the
residue, which yet remained in the hands of them whome he had appointed
to the k&eacute;eping of the same. And for assurance of that couenant to be
performed before he departed the realme, he deliuered his brethren, and
one that was his chamberleine, to remaine with the lords as hostages.</p>

<p>This doone, he hasted to Canturburie, where he promised to receiue the
crosse of a pilgrime to go into the holie land, and to render vp the
crosse of his legatship, which he had vsurped a yeare and a halfe after
the death of pope Clement, to the preiudice of the church of Rome, and
to the detriment and great hinderance of the English church. For there
was not any church within the realme, which had not b&eacute;ene put to fine
<span class="rightnote">The print of the legats crosse.</span>
and ransome by that crosse, nor any ecclesiasticall person went fr&eacute;e,
but the print of the crosse appeared in him and his purse. From
Canturburie he got him to Douer to his brother in law, and finallie
s&eacute;eking means to passe ouer into France, and doubting to be discouered,
he apparelled himselfe in womans raiment, &amp; got a web of cloth on his
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Elie late lord chancellor disguiseth himselfe
in womans apparell.<br />
He is bewraied.</span>
arme, as though he had beene some housewifelie woman of the countrie:
but by the vntowardlie folding and vncunning handling of his cloth (or
rather by a lewd fisherman that tooke him for an harlot) he was
suspected and searched so narrowlie, that by his priuie members he was
prooued to be a man, and at length knowne, attached, and committed to
prison, after he had beene reprochfullie handled by them that found him,
and by the wiues of the towne, in such vns&eacute;emlie apparell.</p>

<p>Earle John would haue had him punished, and put to some open reproofe
for his passed tyrannicall dooings; but the bishops, and other of the
<span class="rightnote">Earle John not y<sup>e</sup> bishops fr&eacute;end.</span>
barons, for reuerence of his order, procured his deliuerance, with
licence to passe ouer into Normandie where he was borne. Thus was the
bishop of Elie a man full of pride and couetousnesse ouerthrowne with
shame, and receiued for his hie climing a reprochfull downefall: for
none are more subiect to ruine and rebuke, than such as be aloft and
supereminent ouer others, as the poet noteth well saieng:</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
In time he was deposed from his office of being chancellour, and not
without warrant, for in verie d&eacute;ed, king Richard hauing receiued
aduertisements from the lords and peeres of the realme, of the
chancellours presumptuous and hautie demeanour, with wrongs offered to
diuerse persons, wrote to them againe as followeth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>A letter of king Richard directed to the States of the land for the
deposing of the bishop of Elie from his office of lord chancellour.</h3>

<p>Richard king of England sendeth greeting to William Marshall, to Gilbert
Fitz Peter, and Henrie Berdulfe, and to William Brewer, peeres. If it so
chance that our chancellour hath not faithfullie handled the affaires
and businesse of our realme (committed vnto him) by the aduise and
counsell of you, and others to whome we haue also assigned the charge of
gouernement of the same realme: we command you, that according to your
disposition in all things to be doone concerning the gouernement
thereof, you order and dispose as well for eschetes, as all other
things, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>By force of this commission, the lords were the bolder to proc&eacute;ed
against him as ye haue heard. Now after his comming into the parties
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Elie complaineth of his wrongs receiued.</span>
beyond the seas, he ceassed not with letters and messengers to present
his complaint to the pope of Rome, and to king Richard of the iniuries
receiued at the hands of earle John and his complices. Herevpon pope
Celestine wrote in d&eacute;ed to all the archbishops and bishops that were
<span class="rightnote">The popes letters vnto the archbishope and bishops of
England.</span>
within the realme of England, in behalfe of the said bishop of Elie,
declaring, that for so much as the king of England was gone into the
holie land to warre against the enimies of our faith, leauing his
kingdome vnder the protection of the apostolike see, he could not but
haue speciall regard to see that the state, rights and honour thereof
were preserued from all danger of decaie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Note how the pope defendeth his chaplins.</span>
Wherefore, vnderstanding that there had beene certeine attempts made by
John erle of Mortaigne and others, both against the king and the bishop
of Elie, that was not onelie legat of the apostolike s&eacute;e, but also
gouernour of the land appointed by the king, which attempt sounded
greatlie to the reproch of the church of Rome, and danger of damage to
insue to king Richard, if remedie were not the sooner found: therefore
he commanded them by the vertue of their obedience, to exc&#333;municat
the earle of Mortaigne, or any other that was knowne to haue laid any
violent hands vpon the said bishop of Elie, or deteined him as captiue,
or inforced him to any oth, or else had changed the state of rule in the
kingdome of England to other forme, than king Richard had ordeined at
his setting forward towards the holie land: and that not onelie all the
councellours, authors, aiders and complices of those that had committed
such outrage, but also their lands should stand interdicted, so that no
diuine seruice should be vsed within the precinct of the same, except
penance and christning of infants. This to remaine till the said bishop
&amp; kingdome were restored into the former estate: and that the parties
excommunicated should present themselues with letters from the bishops
vnto the apostolike see to be absolued, etc.</p>

<p>Herevpon also the bishop of Elie himselfe wrote vnto the bishop of
Lincolne and other, touching this matter: but the bishops did neither
any thing in accomplishment of the effect of the popes letters, nor at
his owne supplication. And therefore perceiuing small helpe to come that
waie, he sought to obteine the fauour and fr&eacute;endship of earle John, and
of his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor. In the meane time, the lords, barons and
prelates of the realme, after they had depriued him of all authoritie,
and banished him out of the land, ordeined the archbishop of Rouen in
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Rouen ch&eacute;efe gouernour of England.</span>
fauour of the kings commission, to haue the ch&eacute;efe rule and
administration of things touching all the affaires of the common-wealth;
but yet so as earle John had the dooings in manie points, so that he
might s&eacute;eme in manner an associat with him, whereof sprang much
inconuenience. For this
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" ></a><span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
John being a man (as he is noted by some
writers) of an ambitious nature, was suspected to aspire vnto the
kingdome: in somuch that he had ioined with the French king, after the
same king was returned foorth of the holie land, against his brother
king Richard, if his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor had not persuaded him to the
contrarie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> Fiftene saith <i>Functius</i>, but
others agr&eacute;e with <i>Houed.</i> as <i>Gerardus Mercator</i> citing <i>Albericus</i> a
moonke.</span>
Whilest these things were a dooing, on the twelfth daie of Julie, the
citie of Acres was surrendred into the Christian mens hands, for the
Soldan Saladine (being approched n&eacute;ere to the siege of the christians
with a puissant armie, in hope to haue raised their siege) when he
perceiued it laie not in his power to worke any feat to the succour of
his people within the citie, and that they were so constreined that they
must n&eacute;eds y&eacute;eld, he holpe to make their composition, and promised to
performe certeine couenants on their behalfe. Herevpon, the Saracens
within Acres couenanted not onelie to deliuer the citie vnto the
christians with fiue hundred prisoners of christians which they had
within the same, but also to procure that the holie crosse should be to
them deliuered, with a thousand other christian prisoners, such as the
christian princes should appoint out of those numbers which Saladine had
in his custodie, and further, to giue them two hundred thousand Besans.
And till these couenants were performed, it was agr&eacute;ed, that the
Saracens, which were at that present left within the citie, should
remaine as pledges, vnder condition, that if the same couenants were not
performed within fortie daies, then should they stand at the mercie of
the christian princes as touching life and lim.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The citie of Acres.</span>
These things thus concluded, and the citie y&eacute;elded vp into the christian
mens hands, the French king vpon enuie and malice conceiued against king
Richard (although he pretended sicknesse for excuse) departed homewards,
<span class="rightnote">The French K. returneth home.</span>
setting from Acres the last day of Julie. Now then, after the departure
of king Philip, when the day approched, in the which the Saracens should
performe the couenants; or else stand to the iudgement of life and death
at the pleasure of the christian princes: it was perceiued that the
couenants would not be fulfilled according to the agr&eacute;ement. For
Saladine, as it well appeared, ment not to performe that which for the
safegard of his men he had vndertaken, and did but dallie with the
christians to prolong the time: wherevpon sentence was giuen foorth,
that for default in such behalfe, the Saracens remaining as pledges
should loose their heads.</p>

<p>Saladine hauing knowledge thereof, sent word to king Richard and to the
whole christian armie, that if his people that were in the christian
mens hands lost their heads, he would not faile but cause the heads of
all those christians which he had in captiuitie to be cut off also.
Notwithstanding which answer, on the fourteenth day of August king
Richard issued foorth of the citie, passing the vttermost ditches, and
incamped himselfe neere the armie of Saladine, who the same daie sent
rich presents vnto king Richard, requiring of him a longer day for
performance of the couenants, but that would not be granted. Wherefore
<span class="rightnote">Saladine causeth the christian prisoners to be beheaded.</span>
vpon the said deniall, Saladine caused all those christian prisoners
which he had in his hands to be beheaded on the eight&eacute;enth day of
August, on which day king Richard aduanced foorth towards the lodgings
of the Saracens, and skirmished with them verie hotlie, so that manie
were wounded and slaine on both parts: and amongst other one of king
Richards companions at all exercises named Peter Mignot lost his life
there. Furthermore, although king Richard knew that Saladine had put the
christian prisoners to death in such wise as you haue heard, yet would
not he preuent his terme appointed for the execution of the Saracens
that were in his custodie, but abiding vnto the twentith day of August,
he then caused those Saracens which fell to his lot, at the time of the
surrender of Acres, being in number about 2600. to be brought foorth of
the citie, and n&eacute;ere to the walles in the sight of Saladine and all his
host they had their heads chopped off. The duke of Burgoigne caused
execution to be doone within the citie vpon those which fell to the
French kings share, the number of the which rose to two thousand and
foure hundred, or thereabouts: for the whole number was reckoned to be
about fiue thousand that thus lost their liues through the inconstancie
of their prince: yet diuerse of
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" ></a><span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
the principall had their liues saued.
The Saracens themselues also spake much euill of Saladine for this
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
matter, bicause that refusing to performe the articles of couenants, he
had occasioned the enimie to slea those that had so valiantlie serued in
defense of the citie, to the vttermost ieopardie of their liues. And
heere is verified that knowne verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quicquid delirant reges plectuntur Achiui.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
But now to leaue forren matters, and to returne home into England: we
find, that on the second of December, the monks of Canturburie chose to
their archbishop Reignold bishop of Bath, who within fifteene daies
after his election, departed this life, and lieth buried at Bath. Also
this yeare, or (as Ger. Dor. saith) in the yeare following, the bishop
<span class="rightnote">Strife betwixt y<sup>e</sup> archbishop of York and the bishop of
Durham.</span>
of Durham sought meanes to withdraw his subiection from the archbishop
of Yorke, for which attempt the archbishop of Yorke, vpon trust of the
popes grant, did not excommunicate the said bishop, notwithstanding that
he appealed to the popes consistorie three seuerall times, putting his
owne matter and his churches to be examined and tried by the pope, where
vpon he obeied not the excommunication: and signifieng the cause vnto
Rome, obteined such fauour, that the pope and his cardinals reuersed the
sentence, and iudged the excommunication to be of none effect. And
further they decreed, that if the archbishop of Yorke had broken the
altars and chalices, as information was giuen, in which the bishop of
Durham had celebrated after his appeale made to the court of Rome, that
then should the said bishop of Durham be acquited from owing any
subiection to the said archbishop for so long as they two should liue
togither.</p>

<p>True it is, that the archbishop had not onelie broken the altars and
chalices which the bishop had vsed in d&eacute;ed for the celebration of masse,
but also held his owne brother John earle of Mortaigne for
excommunicate, bicause he had eat and dronke in companie of the said
bishop, and would not communicate with him, till he came to receiue
absolution, and to make satisfaction for his fault. In the end the
bishops of Lincolne and Rochester, with the abbat of Peterburrow, were
appointed by the pope to haue the hearing of this matter, as iudges
authorised by his buls, who sat therevpon at Northampton, vpon S. Calixt
his day, where after they had heard both parties argue what they could
in either of their cases, they gaue a longer day, to wit, vntill the
feast of the natiuitie of saint John Baptist next after, to see if by
anie good means there might some agr&eacute;ement haue beene had betwixt them,
or (if that could not be) that then the popes leters should stand in
force as before, &amp; the helpes of either part saued, as though no delaie
had b&eacute;ene vsed. And to this, both parties were agreeable, speciallie at
the motion of the bishop of Lincolne.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Roger Lacie conestable of Chester.</span>
This yeare also, Roger de Lacie conestable of Chester tooke Alan de Lec
and Peter de Bouencort, and vpon despite hanged them, for that being put
in trust amongst other with the k&eacute;eping of the castels of Notingham and
Tickhill, which he had receiued into his custodie of the bishop of Elie
quondam lord chancellour, they had consented to the treason of Robert de
Crokeston, &amp; Eudo de Duuille, which deliuered the same castels vnto John
earle of Mortaigne. The same earle of Mortaigne was highlie offended for
the death of those two persons, and therefore wasted the lands of the
said Roger which lay within the compasse of his iurisdiction.</p>

<p>But now touching the departure of the French king from Acres, diuerse
occasions are remembred by writers of the emulation and secret spite
which he should beare towards king Richard, and beside other alreadie
touched, one was for enterteining and rel&eacute;euing the earle of Champaigne
in such bountifull wise in his necessitie, that he was readie to forsake
the French kings seruice, and cleaue to king Richard. But howsoeuer it
came to passe, partlie through enuie (as hath b&eacute;ene thought) conceiued
at the great d&eacute;eds of king Richard, whose mightie power and valiantnesse
he could not well abide, and partlie for other respects him moouing, he
tooke the sea with thr&eacute;e gallies of the Geneuois, and returned into
Italie, and so home into France, hauing promised first vnto king Richard
at his departure out of the holie land, and after to pope Celestine at
Rome, that he would
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" ></a><span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
not attempt any hurtfull enterprise against the
English dominions, till king Richard should be returned foorth of the
<span class="rightnote">The euill dealling &amp; breach of promise of the French king.</span>
holie land. But this promise was not kept, for after that he was
returned into France, he first sought to procure the foresaid erle John,
king Richards brother, to rebell against him, promising him not onelie
aid to reduce all his brothers dominions into his hands, but also to
giue his sister Adela in marriage, whom king Richard vpon suspicion of
vnchast liuing, had forsaken, as before ye haue heard. But when earle
John was dissuaded by his mother, from accepting this offer (which
otherwise as it is said he would willinglie haue receiued) king Philip
still reteined a malicious rancor in his hart, and in reuenge of old
displeasures, would haue attempted the warre against the subiects of
king Richard, if his lords would haue ioined with him: but they
considering what slander would redound hereby both to him and them for
the iniurie doone to the christian common-welth, in making warre against
him that was occupied in defense of the faith against the common enimies
of christendome, would not giue their consent thereto, and so the matter
rested, till king Richard was taken prisoner in Almaigne, and then what
followed, it shall after appeare.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> Enuious discord among the christians.</span>
In the meane while, the christian armie atchiued some worthie
enterprises in the holie land, though not manie, by reason of such
enuious discord as reigned amongst the ch&eacute;efe gouernours. It chanced yet
on the &eacute;eue of the Natiuitie of our ladie next after the departure of
king Philip, as king Richard marched foorth towards Japh ancientlie
called Joppa, that the Soldan Saladine taking aduantage of the place,
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard discomfiteth the Saracens n&eacute;ere to Port Japh.</span>
did set vpon the rereward of the christians: but his Saracens (after
they had fought right fiercelie from noone till sunne setting) were so
beaten backe at length, and repelled with such losse and disaduantage,
that in 40. yeares before they had not susteined at one time greater
damage. Amongst other of the christians slaine at that encounter, was
one James Dauenes, a man of high prowesse and valiancie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Moreouer, king Richard wan diuerse townes and castels out of the enimies
hands, as Ascalon, Darus, and diuerse other, and some he fortified, as
Ascalon aforesaid, and Port Japh, otherwise called Joppa. There were
sundrie encounters also betwixt the Saracens and christians, wherein
king Richard and his people bare themselues so manfullie, that the
victorie for the most part continuallie rested on their side. At one
<span class="yearnote">1192.</span>
time also, hearing of a great conueie of vittels, munitions, and other
things which came from Babylon towards Jerusalem to furnish Saladine and
his armie (which conueies they call carauannes) king Richard with a
competent power of men met them on the waie, and distressed those that
were attendant vpon the safegard of that carriage, being in number about
two thousand horssemen, besides a great multitude of footmen, and
therewith tooke the carriages with foure thousand and six hundred camels
and dromedaries, besides an innumerable sort of mules, asses, and other
beasts of burthen.</p>

<p>&para; But to speake of all the worthie exploits atchiued by king Richard and
his valiant capteins there in the holie land against the infidels, it
would require a long treatise, and therefore here we passe them ouer.
This is to be noted, that amongst other of whom we find honorable
mention made by writers for their high valiancie shewed in those
<span class="rightnote">The names of such noble men as were famous for their valiant
dooings in this voiage.</span>
exploits, these are named as cheefe, Robert earle of Leicester, Hubert

diuerse other, as Hugh de Gourney, William de Borrez, Walcline de

Britans, Gascoignes, as other nations, of whome partlie mention is
alreadie made before in this booke, and partlie for breefenesse diuerse
are omitted.</p>

<p>But now to returne, sure it is, that king Richard meant to haue
recouered the citie of Jerusalem, and all the holie land out of the
Saracens hands, by the assistance of almightie God: if the doubt which
he had of his brother the earle of Mortaigns practises, &amp; the French
kings doings, which were brought to him with a greeuous report, had not
<span class="rightnote"><i>Galf.&nbsp;Vinsaf.</i></span>
reuoked him home. For diuerse messengers were sent dailie into the holie
land, to aduertise him of such dangers as were like to insue, if by his
speedie returne the same were not preuented. And first after Easter,
there came to him the prior of Hereford with letters from the bishop of
Elie, conteining a sore information against his brother earle John, for
hauing expelled those whom he had appointed rulers ouer the realme of
England, and altered the state of things there contrarie to the
ordinances by him deuised afore his setting forward vpon his iournie (as
before ye haue partlie heard.)</p>

<p>Vpon receipt of which letters, he meant immediatlie at the first to haue
returned, and to haue left behind him a conuenient power of men, to wit,
thr&eacute;e hundred knights or men of armes, and two thousand chosen footmen,
to abide vpon the defense of the holie land, with other christians at
his costs and charges. But yet at length he was persuaded to tarrie,
speciallie till things were set in some better staie, which were out of
<span class="rightnote">The marques of Montferrato murthered by the Assassini.</span>
order by the death of the marques of Montferrato, lord of Tire, whom two
traitorous Saracens of the kind which they name Assassini had murthered.
After whose death Henrie earle of Champaigne nephue to king Richard
married his wife, and was made king of Jerusalem, Guido resigning to him
his title, vnto whome as it were in recompense king Richard gaue the Ile
of Cypres: although some write, that the knights Templers had bought it
of him before. Thus king Richard remaining still in the holie land,
shortlie after Whitsuntide, there came an other messenger to him, one
John de Alanzon a clearke, bringing worsse newes out of England than the
prior of Hereford had brought before, which in effect conteined, that
<span class="rightnote">Earle John purposed to seize vpon the kingdom in his brothers
absence.</span>
his brother earle John was alied as a confederat with the French king,
and meant through his setting on, to seize into his possession the whole
realme of England, notwithstanding the persuasion of his mother qu&eacute;ene
Elianor and other his fr&eacute;ends to the contrarie.</p>

<p>Herevpon king Richard was fullie persuaded to returne home, but yet
<span class="rightnote">William de Poicters K. Richards chapleine.</span>
through the admonition of certeine persons, and namelie of one William
de Poicters, a chapleine of his, he eftsoones altered his purpose, and
so remained there, till at length through enuie and malice still
increasing amongst the Christians, he perceiued how no good purpose go
forward, since that which s&eacute;emed good to some, was misliked of other;
and speciallie our writers put great blame in the French men, who either
vpon disdaine or other displeasure would not be persuaded to follow
their aduise, which were knowne best to vnderstand the state of things
in those parties. And herevpon, when the armie was aduanced to
Betenoble, a place not past foure leagues distant from Jerusalem,
bicause their mind might not be fulfilled for the besieging of
Jerusalem, which they had intended to take in hand (whereas the residue
would rather that they shuld haue gone to besiege Babylon in Aegypt, and
that vpon sundrie great respects) the Frenchmen raised their field, and
returned againe to Acres in great despite, putting the rest of the armie
also (so much as in them laie) in danger of vtter ruine and distresse.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;4.</span>
Then king Richard and the other Christian capteins perceiuing how the
matter inclined, and giuing ouer all hope of any more good successe,
followed them. So that after they were thus returned to Acres, king
Richard still doubting least his long absence from home might put him in
danger of more losse here, than he saw hope of present gaine to be had
there, in such diuersitie of humours and priuie malice which reigned
among them, he determined fullie to depart homewards, with no lesse
purpose to returne thither againe after he had setled things at home in
such sure stay as was expedient for the suertie of
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" ></a><span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
his owne estate and
quietnesse of his people. Herevpon being readie to enter into his ships
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
at Acres [or as some haue, being on his iournie homewards in Cypres] he
was aduertised that the Souldane Saladine had taken the town of Japh,
slaine a great number of the christians within it, and besieged the
residue within the castell, the which (constreined through feare) had
compounded to y&eacute;eld, if within thr&eacute;e daies there came no succour.</p>

<p>King Richard being hereof aduertised, and turning gr&eacute;ef into valiancie,
with all sp&eacute;ed sailed backe vnto Japh, and landing there with his
people, caused his enimies to forsake the towne: but anon assembling
themselues againe togither, they turned once more to besiege it,
wherevpon he issued foorth into the fields, and fought with them sundrie
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard rescueth Port Japh.</span>
daies togither, till finallie they were content to forsake their
enterprise, and to depart thence for altogither. In these conflicts the
valiant courage of King Richard, and the worthie manhood of his
souldiers right well appeared: <span class="rightnote"><i>Rad.&nbsp;Niger.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
for he brought not with him at that time
vnto Japh aboue 80 men of armes, and foure hundred other souldiers with
crossebowes, and yet with that small handfull of men, and some aid of
them that he found there in the castell, he did not onelie bid battell
to the enimies, which were numbered to 62 thousand, but also put them to
the woorsse, and caused them to flee backe, to their great shame and
confusion.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Cephas. K. Richard fell sicke.</span>
Thus Japh being deliuered out of the enimies hands, king Richard fell
sicke at a castell called Cephas, and so remained there certeine daies,
till he had recouered his health. In which meane time the Soldane
Saladine seeming to lament his case, sent vnto him certeine of his
councellors to common with him of peace, declaring that although he well
vnderstood that king Richard ment shortlie to returne into his countrie,
and that after his departure out of the east parts, he could with small
adoo recouer all that the christians yet held within the holie land, he
would neuerthelesse in respect of king Richards high prowes, and noble
valliancie, grant a peace for a certeine time, so that not onelie
Ascalon, but also all other such townes and places as the christians had
fortified or woone since the conquest of Acres should be raced, as
touching their walles, bulworks, gates, and other fortifications.</p>

<p>King Richard (though he perceiued that this offer of peace tended vnto
this point cheefelie, that Saladine would thereby adnihilate whatsoeuer
the christian armie had doone in the holie land since his &amp; the French
kings arriuall, so that by the said peace he should gaine more than by
the edge of his sword) did somewhat staie at this offer and demand, as a
thing greatlie dishonourable to the christians, to lose by treatie of
peace so much or rather more than they got by force of warres (a meere
token of faint and f&eacute;eble courage) yet considering that in such
necessitie both of his departure from thence, and also of lacke of other
succors to resist the puissance of the enimies, after his comming awaie,
he iudged it best to take the offer at the enimies hands in auoiding of
<span class="rightnote">A peace concluded betwixt the Christians &amp; Saracens.</span>
some greater euill. Herevpon therefore was a peace concluded to endure
for thr&eacute;e yeares, thr&eacute;e moneths, thr&eacute;e w&eacute;eks, thr&eacute;e daies, and three
houres, to begin at Easter next insuing. And among other articles, it
was couenanted, that the christians should haue fr&eacute;e passage to come and
go vnto the citie of Jerusalem, to visit the holie sepulchre there,
which was granted; so that amongst a great number of christians that
<span class="rightnote">Hubert bishop of Salisburie.</span>
presentlie vpon this conclusion went thither, Hubert bishop of
Salisburie was one, who had continued about the king during the time of
all his iournie till this time.</p>

<p>King Richard hauing thus concluded with Saladine, tooke the sea, and
comming againe into Cypres, sent his wife queene Berengaria with his
sister Joane (late qu&eacute;ene of Sicile) into England by the long seas, but
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard taketh his iornie homewards.</span>
he himselfe not minding to lie long on the seas, determined to take his
course into Grecia, and so by land to passe homewards with all speed
possible. Howbeit yer he could atteine his purpose, his chance was to be
driuen by tempest into the coast of Istria, not farre from Aquilia,
where he stood in some doubt of his life. For if he had beene knowne and
taken, they would surelie haue killed him,
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" ></a><span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
bicause of the slander that
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard slandered for the death of y<sup>e</sup> marques of
Montferrato.</span>
went of him, as guiltie of the death of Conrade the marquesse of
Montferrato, who ind&eacute;ed was slaine by two of the Assassini in the citie
of Tyrus, whilest king Richard was in the holie land (as before y&eacute;e haue
heard.)</p>

<p>He therefore hauing here made shipwracke, and doubting to fall into the
hands of any person in those parts that bare good will vnto the
marquesse (against whome he had indeed shewed himselfe not fr&eacute;endlie in
a quarrell betwixt the said marquesse and Guido king of Jerusalem) made
the best shift he could to get away, yet knowledge being had of him, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> Erle of Gorze Saltzburge.</span>
serch made after him by one Meinard of Gorezein, he lost eight of his
seruants, and so came to a towne within the bishoprike of Saltzburge
called Frisake, where he was eftsoones in danger to haue beene taken
againe by one Frederike de saint Soome, who notwithstanding tooke six of
his men, but yet he himselfe with three other of his companie made shift
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard commeth to Vienna.</span>
to get away. Finallie comming to Vienna in Austrich, and there causing
his seruants to prouide meat for him, more sumptuous and fine than was
thought requisit for so meane a person as he counterfeited then to beare
out in countenance, it was streightwaies suspected that he was some
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
other maner of man than he pretended, and in fine, those that marked
more diligentlie the maner of him, perceiued what he was, and gaue
knowledge to the duke of Austrich named Leopold, being then in the citie
of Vienna, what they had seene. His page that had the Dutch toong, going
about the towne to change gold, and buy vittels, bewraied him, hauing by
chance the kings gloues vnder his girdle: wherevpon comming to be
examined for feare of tortures confessed the truth.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ra.&nbsp;Niger.</i></span>
The duke streightwaies caused the house where he was lodged, to be set
about with armed men, and sent other into the house to apprehend him. He
being warie that he was descried, got him to his weapon: but they
aduising him to be contented, and alledging the dukes commandement, he
boldlie answered, "that sith he must be taken, he being a king, would
y&eacute;eld himselfe to none of the companie but to the duke alone, and
therefore if it would please him to come, he would y&eacute;eld himselfe into
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard submitteth himselfe to the duke of Austrich.</span>
his hands." The duke hearing of this, sp&eacute;edilie came vnto him, whom he
meeting, deliuered vp his sword, and committed him vnto his custodie.
The duke reioising of such a preie, brought him vnto his palace, and
with gentle words enterteined him, though he meant no great good towards
him, as well inough appeared in that he committed him to the keeping of
certeine gentlemen, which without much courtesie looked streightlie
inough to him for starting awaie, in somuch that they kept him in cold
irons (as some authours doo write.) He was taken after the maner
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
aforesaid in December vpon S. Thomas &eacute;eue, in the y&eacute;ere of our Lord
1192. and in the fourth yeare of his reigne.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polychron.</i></span>
The duke of Austrich owght the king no good will, bicause he had cast
downe his ensignes pitcht vp in a turret at Acres, which he had woone at
the verie time when that citie was deliuered by the Saracens: for while
they were in tretie on the one side, the duke on the other, not knowing
<span class="rightnote">The cause of the displeasure betwixt the duke of Austrich &amp;
king Richard.</span>
anie thing thereof, gaue the assault vnto that part of the towne which
was appointed vnto him to besiege. And so being entred the towne, and
perceiuing that by treatie it was to be deliuered, he retired into the
turret which he had first woone and entred, and there set vp his
standard and ensignes, which king Richard (as the Dutch writers affirme)
comming thither, threw downe and trode vnder his f&eacute;et.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
But Geruasius Dorobornensis declareth this matter somewhat otherwise, as
thus. After that the said citie of Acres was rendred into the christian
mens hands (saith he) diuerse lords tooke their lodgings as they thought
good, and hanged foorth their ensignes. And as it chanced, the duke of
Austrich placing himselfe in one of the fairest palaces of all the
citie, put foorth his ensigne, whereof king Richard being warie, came
thither with a companie of hardie souldiers about him, and threw downe
the dukes ensigne, so displacing him out of that so pleasant and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
beautifull a lodging. For this cause, and also surmizing that king
Richard should be guiltie of the death of the marques Conrade, the duke
of Austrich shewed such discourtesie towards him. But concerning the
murther of
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" ></a><span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
the marques, the ch&eacute;efe gouernour of those Saracens called
Assassini cleared king Richard by a letter written and directed vnto the
duke of Austrich in manner as followeth.</p>

<h3>The same in English.</h3>

<p>Vetus de Monte to Lupold duke of Austrich sendeth greeting. Where manie
kings and princes beyond the seas blame Richard king of England of the
marques his death, I sweare by the lord that reigneth euerlastinglie,
and by the law which we hold, that he was not in fault for his death.
For the verie cause of the marques his death was such as followeth. One
of our brethren in a ship of Satalie came towards our parties, and
chanced by tempest to be driuen vnto Tyre, and the marques caused him to
be taken and slaine and tooke a great portion of monie that he had in
the ship with him. Whervpon we sent our messengers to the marques,
commanding him to restore vnto vs the monie of our brother, and to
compound with vs for our said brothers death, and he would not.</p>

<p>Moreouer, he also contemned our messengers, &amp; laid the fault of our
brothers death vpon Reginald lord of Sidon, and we did so much through
our freends, that we got full vnderstanding that the marques himselfe
caused him to be slaine, and tooke his monie. And therefore we sent vnto
him againe an other messenger named Edrisus, whome he would haue drowned
in the sea, but our freends made such shift, that they procured him to
depart with speed from Tyre, who returned to vs, and signified these
things to vs for certeine. And from that houre euer after we had a
desire to slea the marques: and so
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" ></a><span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
then we sent two of our brethren
vnto Tyre, who openlie, &amp; in a manner in presence of all the people of
Tyre slue him.</p>

<p>This therefore was the verie cause of the death of the marques: &amp; we say
to you in good sooth, that the lord Richard king of England, in this
death of the marques was nothing culpable: and they that haue doone anie
displeasure vnto the king of England for this cause, they haue doone it
wrongfullie, and without anie iust occasion. Know ye for certeine, that
we do not vse to kill anie man of this world for anie bribe, or for
monie, except he haue doone to vs some harme afore time. And know ye
that we haue made these letters in our house at our castell of Messuat,
in the midst of September, in the yeare from Alexander the great, 1505.</p>

</div>

<p>&para; Thus we see how king Richard was cleared of that crime concerning the
marques his death by the tenour of this letter. And verelie it is most
like that king Richard would haue b&eacute;ene loth to haue communicated his
purpose vnto such a wicked kind of pagans as the Assassini were, if he
had pretended any such matter, but rather would haue sought his reuenge
by some other meanes. Now therefore to our purpose.</p>

<p>The newes of the taking of king Richard was anon bruted and blowne ouer
all Germanie, wherevpon the emperour Henrie the sixt, the sonne of
<span class="yearnote">1193.</span>
Frederike the first, sent in all hast vnto the duke, persuading him to
deliuer the king into his hands, being able to susteine and abide the
malice of all them that would be offended with the taking and deteining
of him prisoner, as the pope and others. The emperour well vnderstood
the wealth and riches of England, and therefore hoped to make some good
purchase by ransoming the king, if he might get him out of the dukes
hands. The duke perceiuing also the emperours meaning, durst not well
denie his request, and therefore he deliuered the king vnto them that
<span class="rightnote">The king is deliuered to the emperor. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
were sent from the emperour, who couenanted to giue vnto the said duke
the summe of 6000. pounds of Cullen weight for the hauing of the said
king. The emperour thus receiuing the king at the hands of the duke of
Austrich, commanded that he should be committed to close prison, and
would not doo so much as once speake with him. This he did, to cause the
king vpon an indignation and wearinesse of that maner of life, to make
speed in offering some large masse of monie for his libertie &amp;
deliuerance. &para;&nbsp;Thus we s&eacute;e how couetousnesse infected the hearts of the
mightie, and what occasion the emperour and duke did take, to inrich
themselues by the meanes of the king, whome they forced not to
impouerish, so their owne greedie worme were serued. But this hath b&eacute;ene
a disease not so generall as ancient, according to his words that said,</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Here is to be remembred by the waie, that about the same time, or
somewhat before, in the yeare of our Lord 1192. the pope sent two legats
<span class="rightnote">Two legats from y<sup>e</sup> pope.</span>
(namelie, Octauian bishop of Hostia, and Jordane de Fossa noua) into
Normandie, to reconcile the bishop of Elie and the archbishop of Rouen:
but comming vnto Gisors, they were staied from entring any further into
<span class="rightnote">Normandie interdicted.</span>
the countrie, wherevpon they did interdict the whole duchie of
Normandie, togither with William Fitz Radulfe lord steward of that
countrie, bicause he was the man that had so staied them. Immediatlie
herevpon, queene Elianor, and the archbishop of Rouen sent vnto those
legats Hugh bishop of Durham, requiring them to release that sentence of
interdiction so pronounced against the steward and countrie of Normandie
in the kings absence, but they would not, except they might be receiued
into Normandie: howbeit, the pope being sent vnto, released it, and
caused the legats to release it also, and yet they entred not into
Normandie at all.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Pieregort &amp; others wast the K. of Englands
lands.</span>
This yeare, whilest the seneschall of Gascoigne laie sicke, the earle of
Pieregort, and the vicount of March, and almost all the lords and barons
of Gascoigne, began to waste and destroie the lands of king Richard. And
though the seneschall manie times by messengers required a peace, or at
the least some truce, yet could he not haue any grant
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" ></a><span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
thereof: wherfore vpon his recouerie of health
<span class="rightnote">The seneschal of Gascoigne reuengeth iniurie.</span>
he inuaded the lands of the said earle,
tooke the castels and fortresses and some of them he fortified, and kept
to the kings vse, and some of them he raced downe to the ground. He also
inuaded the vicounts countrie, and subdued it to the kings gouernement.
Shortlie after came the brother of the
<span class="rightnote">The king of Nauarres brother.</span>
king of Nauarre, with eight
hundred knights or men of armes to the seneschals aid, and so they two
togither entring into the lands of the earle of Tholouse, tooke diuerse
castels and fortresses within the same, of the which some they
fortified, and some they raced, and rode euen to the gates of Tholouse,
and lodged in maner vnder the walles of the citie.</p>

<p>A little before Christmas also, diuerse of those that had b&eacute;ene in the
holie land with king Richard, came home into England, not knowing but
that king Richard had beene at home before them, and being asked where
they thought he was become, they could say no more but that they had
seene the ship wherein he first went aboord, arriuing at Brendize in
Puglia. At length, when newes came that he was taken and staied as
prisoner, the archbishop of Rouen and other the rulers of the realme of
<span class="rightnote">The abbats of Boxley and Roberts-bridge.</span>
England, sent the abbat of Boxeley and the abbat of Roberts-bridge with
all sp&eacute;ed into Almaine to speake with him, and to vnderstand his state,
and what his pleasure was in all things. Who comming to Germanie, passed
through the countrie into Baierland, where at a place called Oxefer they
found the king as then on his iournie towards the emperour, to whom (as
y&eacute;e haue heard) the duke of Austrich did send him. The said abbats
attended him to the emperours court, and remained there with him till
the emperour and he were accorded, in manner as after shall be shewed:
and then after Easter they returned with the newes into England.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
Vpon report hereof order was taken for manie things, but cheefelie for
the state: in which dealings, forsomuch as those which had the rule of
the land stood in great doubt of things (for the inconstant nature of
earle John was of them much suspected) first they caused a new oth of
allegiance to be made to king Richard, and receiued of the people. They
fortified also such townes and castels as were of importance, both with
repairing the walles and other defenses about the same, and furnishing
them with men, munition and vittels. Thus was the land brought into some
order.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The French king counselleth K. John to vsurpe against his
brother.</span>
In the meane while, the French king being aduertised that king Richard
was deteined as prisoner reioised not a little thereat, and with all
speed by secret messages did send for his brother earle John, who was
readie to come at his call. And being come, he exhorted him not to
suffer so conuenient an occasion to passe, but to take the gouernement
of the realme of England now into his hands, promising him all such aid
as he could of him reasonablie require: with other like talke still
tending to the prouocation of the earle to forsake his allegiance vnto
his brother. And to say the truth, earle John was easilie persuaded so
to doo, and therefore vpon his immediat returne into England, assembled
an armie, and with the same (and such strangers as he brought with him)
began to prooue maisteries, first winning the castels of Windsore,
Wallingford, Notingham, and diuerse other, and fortifieng the same to
his owne vse and defense.</p>

<p>The barons of the land, iudging such vnlawfull doings not to be anie
longer suffered, first besieged the castell of Windsore, and after
preparing to leuie a greater force, did put them within in such feare,
that they y&eacute;elded vp the same, s&eacute;eking to escape by flight, some into
one place, and some into an other, the which yet being apprehended were
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
put to worthie execution. But this was not doone without continuance of
time, &amp; without great trouble &amp; charges to the realme: for whereas there
was a practise betwixt the French king and earle John, that a great
power of strangers, &amp; namelie Flemings should haue come into the realme
(for whose transporting a great number of ships were brought togither at
Witsand) yet the high prouidence and goodnesse of God disappointed their
purpose. For their messengers being taken which were sent hither into
England, the treason was reuealed, and by the queene mothers appointment
(who cheefelie then ruled the land) a great companie of knights, men of
armes, and commons of the countrie,
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" ></a><span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
watched the sea coasts ouer against
Flanders, to keepe the enimies from landing. They began thus to watch in
the passion w&eacute;eke, and so continued till a certeine time after Easter.
Howbeit earle John came secr&eacute;etlie ouer, in hope to haue not onelie the
assistance of the Welshmen and of manie other his freends in England,
but also of the Scots, howbeit, the king of Scots would not meddle. He
therefore with such Welshmen and other as he had brought ouer, and such
Englishmen as he could get to take his part, began such attempts (as
before ye haue heard) to the disquieting of the whole realme, and great
displeasure of the king.</p>

<p>Moreouer, beside that power of the barons which laid siege to Windsor
castell, there were Noble men also in other parts of the realme that
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Yorke. Hugh Bardolfe. William de
Stuteuille.</span>
were readie to resist him. And amongst other, Geffrey the archbishop of
Yorke, with Hugh Bardolfe one of the kings iustices, and William de
Stuteuille, assembled an armie, and comming to Doncaster, fortified<a name="FNanchor_6_9" id="FNanchor_6_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the
towne: but when the archbishop would haue gone forward to besiege the
castell of Tickhill, which earle John had in possession, the other two
his associats would not consent to go with him, bicause they were
seruants, and reteined with earle John. Herewith the archbishop being
sore offended, departed from them, calling them traitors to their king,
and enimies to the realme.</p>

<p>About the same time did the French king enter into Normandie with an
armie, &amp; comming to the towne of Gisors, besieged it, the which one
Gilbert de Vascoll or Guascoill capteine thereof (to his high reproch)
y&eacute;elded vp vnto him, with an other castell also called Nefle, which he
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
had likewise in k&eacute;eping. After this, the French king entring into the
countrie of Veuxine or Veulquessine, wan diuers towns and fortresses in
the same, and passing forward, tooke Val de Rueil, and Neusburge, and
<span class="rightnote">Rouen besieged. The earle of Leicester.
</span>
finallie comming before the citie of Rouen he laid siege thereto: but
the earle of Leicester being gotten into the citie before the French
kings comming thither, so incouraged the citizens, that they stoutlie
standing to their defense, caused the French king to his great dishonour
to raise his field, hauing lost there more than he wan. Yet to saue
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
other townes and castels from taking, and the countrie from destruction,
the rulers of the same procured a truce for a great summe of monie,
which they couenanted to giue, deliuering vp foure notable castels by
waie of engagement, till the summe agreed vpon should be to him
contented and dulie paid.</p>

<p>In the meane time, earle John as head of all the conspiratours,
perceiuing himselfe not able to atchieue his purpose as then, nor to
resist the lords and barons of the realme, being vp in armour against
him, and now growen to greater stomach, bicause they vnderstood by the
bishop of Salisburie latelie arriued, of the kings welfare, and hope of
deliuerance; and furthermore, considering that he was disappointed both
of Scots and Flemings as he had well hoped should haue come to his aid:
he tooke a truce with the lords of the kings side, by the earnest
<span class="rightnote">Michaelmas, saith <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dorob.</i></span>
trauell of the bishop of Salisburie, till the feast of All saincts, so
as the castels of Windsore, Wallingford, and the Peake, should remaine
in the hands of his mother queene Elianor; but the castels of Notingham
and Tickhill remained still in his owne possession, the which with such
other castels as he held within the land, he furnished with garrisons of
his owne men and freends, and then went againe ouer into France to the
French king, to purchase some new aid at his hands according to his
promise.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
Here will we leaue earle John conferring with the French king, and
returne to the king of England. Vpon Palmesundaie after that he was
deliuered (or rather betraied) into the emperours hands, he was brought
<span class="rightnote">The emperour chargeth king Richard with iniuries doone to the
Sicilians.</span>
before the princes and lords of the empire, in whose presence the
emperour charged him with diuerse vnlawfull dooings: and namelie picked
a quarell at him for the wrongs and hurts doone to the Sicilians in time
of his soiourning in their Ile, as he went towards the holie land. For
albeit the said emperour had nothing as then to doo in the countrie, yet
for somuch as he had latelie recouered the Ile of Sicile out of king
Tancreds hands, and was now intituled king thereof by the pope, in right
of
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" ></a><span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
his wife Constance, the daughter of Roger king of Sicile, and so by
reason therof seemed to be gr&eacute;euouslie offended with him for his dooings
about the recouering of the monie from Tancred, which neuerthelesse was
iustlie due vnto his sister for her dowrie, as in the processe afore I
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> The kings wisdome in making his
answere.</span>
haue alreadie declared. King Richard notwithstanding these vaine and
other friuolous obiections laid to his charge, made his answears alwaies
so pithilie and directlie to all that could be laid against him, and
excused himselfe in euerie point so not onelie greatlie commended him
for the same, but from thencefoorth vsed him more courteouslie, and
suffered that his fr&eacute;ends might haue accesse to him more fr&eacute;elie than
before they could be permitted.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
The pope also being aduertised of the taking of king Richard, was much
offended, that anie Christian prince, hauing taken vpon him the defense
of the Christian faith against the infidels, should be so vsed in his
returne from so godlie an enterprise: and therefore sent both to the
duke of Austrich, and to the emperour, requiring them to set him at
libertie. But the emperour declared plainlie that he would be answered
for such summes of monie as king Richard had taken out of Sicile before
he would release him or set him at libertie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Salisburie sent into England.</span>
When king Richard perceiued that no excuses would serue, though neuer so
iust, but that he must n&eacute;eds paie to his couetous host some great summe
of monie for his hard interteinment, he sent the bishop of Salisburie
into England, to take order with the barons of the realme to prouide for
the paiment of his ransome, which bishop (as y&eacute;e haue heard) after the
peace concluded with Saladine, went vnto Jerusalem to visit the holie
sepulchre, and now comming into Sicile, as he returned homewards, had
knowledge there how king Richard was taken prisoner in Austrich, and
remained in the emperours hands: wherevpon he turned that waie foorth,
and comming to him, was now sent into England with commission (as I haue
said) to leauie monie for the kings ransome. He landed here the twentith
day of Aprill, by whose comming the land was the sooner brought in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
quiet: for the agr&eacute;ement which earle John tooke (as before y&eacute;e haue
heard) was cheefelie procured by his meanes. For till his comming, the
castell of Windsore was not woone, the siege being but slackelie
followed by the archbishop of Rouen, who had diuerse of his fr&eacute;ends
within it, and therefore was not verie earnest against them.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The bishop of Elie commeth to the king.</span>
When the bishop of Salisburie was departed towards England, the bishop
of Elie came to the king and trauelled so earnestlie betwixt the
emperour and him, that finallie the emperour (partlie through his suit,
&amp; partlie for that he had beene verie much called vpon by the pope and
other for his deliuerie) tooke order with him for the red&eacute;eming of his
<span class="rightnote">The emperor agr&eacute;eth with king Richard for his ransome.
<i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
libertie, and appointed what summe he should pay for his ransome, which
(as some write) was two hundred thousand markes: other saie that it was
but 140 thousand marks of the poise of Cullen weight. But William
Paruus, who liued in those daies, affirmeth it was one hundred thousand
pounds, and Roger Houeden saith an hundred thousand marks of Cullen
poise, to be paid presentlie at the kings first comming into England,
and fiftie thousand marks afterwards, that is to say, thirtie thousand
to the emperour, and twentie thousand to the duke of Austrich, as it
were in recompense of the iniurie done to him in the holie land; where
king Richard ouerthrew his ensignes: and for the same to deliuer
sufficient suerties.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> Lands assigned to king Richard.</span>
Moreouer, we find in Roger Houeden that the emperour amongst other the
articles of this agr&eacute;ement thus concluded betwixt him and king Richard,
gaue and granted, and by his letters patents confirmed vnto him these
lands hereafter mentioned, that is to saie: Prouance with the citie of
Vienne, and Viennois, the citie of Marseils, Narbon, Arles and Lion vpon
the Rhone, with the countrie vp to the Alps, and all those possessions
which belonged to the empire in Burgoine, with the homages of the king
of Aragon and of the earle of S. Giles: wherein is to be noted, that
with the precinct of the premisses thus granted to king Richard, fiue
archbishops s&eacute;es, and thirtie three bishops s&eacute;es are included. Howbeit
the truth is, that the emperour neuer had possession of these countries,
cities,
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" ></a><span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
and towns himselfe, neither would the inhabitants receiue any
person so by him appointed to their lord and gouernour, wherefore the
king made small account of that his so large grant. But after he once
vnderstood the certeintie of the summe that he should paie for his
ransome (which businesse he most attended) he sent one with letters by
and by and in great hast into England to his treasurers, requiring them
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed to prouide monie, and to send it to him by a
day, that he might be set at libertie with sp&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i><br />
Order taken for leuieng monie to paie the kings ransome.</span>
These letters being come to the qu&eacute;ene mother, and other that had charge
in gouernance of the realme, tooke order that all maner of persons as
well spirituall as temporall, should giue the fourth part of their whole
reuenues to them for that yeare accrewing, and as much more of their
mooueable goods, and that of euerie knights f&eacute;e there should be leuied
the sum of twentie shillings. Also that the religious houses of the
orders of the Cisteaux and Sempringham should giue all their wools for
that yeare towards the kings ransome.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The hard dealing of officers in the collection.</span>
Now those that had commission to leuie this monie, being poisoned with
couetousnesse, and incensed with a gr&eacute;edie desire (than the which as the

<p class="nogap">vsed much streightnesse in exacting it, not onelie leuieng it to the
vttermost value and extent of mens lands, goods, and possessions, but
after their owne willes and pleasures: so that vnder colour of the kings
commission, and letters to them directed, there s&eacute;emed not a tribute or
subsidie to be raised, but by some publike proclamation all the goods
and substance of the people to be appointed as a prey to the kings
officers, whereby it came to passe, that not onelie priuate mens goods,
<span class="rightnote">Church iewels.</span>
but also the chalices, iewels, and vessels belonging to the church were
turned into monie, and a farre greater summe made than was at the first
commanded, a great part of the ouerplus being conuerted to the vse of
those, through whose hands the receipt passed. There was no priuilege
nor freedome allowed to exempt any person or place for being
contributorie towards the paiment of this monie. The order of Cisteaux
that were neuer charged with any paiment before, were now assessed more
d&eacute;epelie than the rest.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Norwich.</span>
The bishop of Norwich lamenting the iniurious dealings of the pettie
officers, and pittieng the people of the church, collected halfe the
value of all the chalices within his diocesse himselfe, and to make vp
the other halfe of the whole summe, he spared not to giue a great
<span class="rightnote">The abbat of saint Albons.</span>
portion of his owne treasure. The abbat of S. Albons acquitted all those
churches within the compasse of his iurisdiction, by the gift of an
hundred marks. But the
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Chester.</span>
bishop of Chester had verie ill lucke with his
collections; for hauing gathered a great summe of monie to the kings
vse, he was spoiled thereof in one night, as he lodged neere vnto
Canturburie, being vpon his iournie towards the king. And bicause
<span class="rightnote">Matthew de Cl&eacute;ere.</span>
Matthew de Cl&eacute;ere that laie in the castell of Douer was knowne to aid
those that robbed the said bishop, the archbishop of Canturburie
pronounced him accurssed.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The bishop of Elie.</span>
About this time, and on the morrow after the natiuitie of saint John
Baptist, the bishop of Elie lord chancellour arriued in England, not
shewing himselfe in any statelie port (for he tooke vpon him neither the
dignitie of chancellour nor legat, nor yet of iustice) but onelie as a
simple bishop and messenger sent from the king. The qu&eacute;ene mother, the
archbishop of Rouen, and such other as had gouernment of the land,
hearing of his comming, met him at saint Albons, where he shewed to them
the emperours letters, conteining the agreement made betwixt him and
king Richard, and withall appointed certeine lords &amp; barons to go with
him at his returne backe to the king, as Gilbert bishop of Rochester,
Sifrid bishop of Chichester, Bennet abbat of Peterborow, Richard earle
of Clare, Roger Bigot earle of Norfolke, Geffrey de Saie, and diuerse
other. It was also ordeined at this same time, that the monie gathered
towards the paiment of the kings ransome should remaine in custodie of

estate of princes, the manifold distresses whereinto by sinister fate
(as well as the inferior &amp; rascall rout of common drudges) they be

deliuered to and fro from the hand of one enimie to another, to be
bought and sold for monie, to stand to the courtesies of forren foes, of

<p>The emperour vpon displeasure conceiued against the bishop of Liege,
which latelie had atteined to that benefice contrarie to the emperours
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Liege murthered.</span>
pleasure, who wished the same rather to an other person, hired certeine
naughtie fellowes to go into France, where the bishop remained for feare
of the emperours malice, and there to find meanes traitorouslie to slea
him, which they accordinglie did, by reason whereof the duke of Louaigne
that was brother to the bishop, and other of his kinsmen, vpon knowledge
had thereof, meant to haue made the emperour warre, in reuenge of that
murther: insomuch that the emperour, to haue the French kings aid
against them, was minded to haue deliuered K. Richard vnto him.</p>

<p>Howbeit after that the matter was taken vp, and a concord made betwixt
the emperour and his nobles, he changed his purpose also touching the
deliuering ouer of king Richard, who perceiuing that till his ransome
were paid (which would amount to the summe of an hundred &amp; fiftie
thousand marks) he should not get libertie: and putting great confidence
in the dexteritie and diligence of Hubert bishop of Salisburie (whome he
sent as ye haue heard into England to deale for the leuieng of the same)
he thought good to aduance the same bishop to the metropolitane s&eacute;e of
Canturburie, which had beene vacant euer sithence the decease of
archbishop Baldwine, that died (as ye haue heard) in the holie land.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
Herevpon writing to the bishops of the realme, and to the moonks of
Canturburie, he required them to proc&eacute;ed to the election of an
archbishop for that see, and withall commended vnto them the foresaid
Hubert, as a man most sufficient and m&eacute;et for that roome. He wrote
<span class="rightnote">Hubert bishop of Salisburie elected archbishop of
C&#257;turburie.</span>
likewise to the queene to further that matter, and easilie hereby
obteined his desire. For shortlie after, the same Hubert was elected by
the bishops and moonks, which assembled togither for that purpose. He
was the 41 archbishop that gouerned that see: for although Reginold
bishop of Bath was elected before him, yet bicause he died yer he was
installed, he is not put in the number.</p>

<p>The king being now put in good hope of his sp&eacute;edie deliuerance, sent
into England, willing his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor, the archbishop of Rouen

<p>Before this king Richard had sent the bishop of Elie into France vnto
his brother earle John, who preuailed so much with him, that he returned
into Normandie, and there sware fealtie vnto his brother king Richard,
and so was contented to forsake the French king. But whereas king
Richard commanded that all such castels and honours as he had giuen to
him afore time, should now be restored to him againe, as well those in
England, as the other on the further side the sea: such as had the same
castels in k&eacute;eping would not obeie the kings commandement herein,
<span class="rightnote">The kings commandement not obeied.</span>
refusing to make restitution of those places, according to the tenour &amp;
purport of the kings writ, vnto the said earle of Mortaigne, by reason
of which refusall, he returned againe to the French king, and stucke to
him. Herevpon the French king gaue vnto him the castels of Dreincourt,
and Arques, the which ought to haue b&eacute;ene deliuered vnto the archbishop
of Reimes as in pledge, who had trauelled as a meane betwixt the French
king to whom he was vncle, and the king of England to whom he was
cousine, procuring a meeting for agreement to be had betwixt them at a
certeine place betwixt Vaucolur and Tulle in the borders of Lorraine.
But notwithstanding all that he could doo, matters were so farre out of
frame, and such
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" ></a><span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
mistrust was entred into the minds of the parties, that
no conclusion held. So that all the hope which king Richard had, was by
paiment of his ransome to red&eacute;eme his libertie, and then to shift with
things as he might. And so finallie when the monie was once readie, or
<span class="yearnote">1194.</span>
rather a sufficient portion thereof, the same was conueied ouer into
Germanie, and paiment made to the emperour of the more part of the kings
ransome, and sufficient pledges left with him for the rest, as the
archbishop of Rouen, the bishop of Bath [Baldwin Wac] and other which
were of late come out of England to see and salute the king.</p>

Herevpon king Richard, after he had beene prisoner one yeare, six

writers agr&eacute;e) and then with long and hastie iournies, not k&eacute;eping the
high waies, he hasted foorth towards England. It is reported that if he
had lingred by the way, he had b&eacute;ene eftsoones apprehended. For the
emperour being incensed against him by ambassadors that came from the
French king, immediatlie after he was set forward, began to repent
himselfe in that he had suffered him so soon to depart from him, and
herevpon sent men after him with all speed to bring him backe if they
could by any meanes ouertake him, meaning as then to haue kept him in
perpetuall prison.</p>

would deliuer him into their hands, or at the leastwise to k&eacute;epe him
prisoner by the terme of one whole yeare.</p>

<p>The emperour hearing of such large offers, and yet hoping for more,
contrarie to his promise and letters patents therefore granted, proroged
the day in which king Richard should haue b&eacute;ene set at libertie, till
Candlemasse after, at which daie he was brought from Haguenaw vnto
Spiers, where the emperour had called a councell to intreat further of
the matter touching his redemption. Here the emperour shewed the letters
which he had receiued from the French king and earle John vnto king
Richard, who vpon sight and perusing of the same, was maruellouslie
amazed, and began to despaire of all speedie deliuerance.</p>

<p>Ind&eacute;ed the emperour sought delaies vpon a couetous desire of the monie
offered by the French king and earle John, but yet such princes and
<span class="rightnote">The princes that had vndertaken for the emperor to performe
the couenants.</span>
great lords as had vndertaken for the emperour, that the couenants and
articles on his part agr&eacute;ed vpon in the accord passed betwixt him and
king Richard, should be in ech behalfe performed [that is to saie, the
archbishops of Ments, Cullen, and Saltzburge, the bishops of Wormes,
Spiers, and Liege, the dukes of Suaben, Austrich, &amp; Louain, the
Palsgraue of the Rhine, and others] came to the emperour, and reproouing
him for his couetous mind, in that he deferred the restoring of king
Richard to his libertie, contrarie to the composition, did so much
preuaile, that the emperour receiuing pledges for the paiment of the
monie yet behind (as before ye haue heard) released king Richard out of
captiuitie on the second or (as Roger Houeden saith) the fourth day of
Februarie, being a dismall day and an infortunate (as they note them in
<span class="rightnote">Robert de Nouant.</span>
kalendars.) And where the king would haue left Robert de Nouant the
bishop of Couentries brother for a pledge amongst the other, he refused
to be one of the number, alledging that he was seruant to earle John.
King Richard greeuouslie offended herewith, commanded that he should be
apprehended, and committed to prison, &amp; so he was. This Robert was one
of those that came with the letters from the French king and earle John
to the emperour, about the staieng of king Richards deliuerance.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" ></a><span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
Furthermore, king Richard the same day in which he was restored to
libertie, summoned by his letters Hugh Nouant bishop of Couentrie, to
appeare in his court, to answer such things as were to be obiected
against him, both before spirituall iudges in that he was a bishop, and
also before temporall in that he had holden and exercised a temporall
office. On the verie same day also the emperour and the princes of the
empire, sent letters vnder their hands and seales to the French king,
and to John erle of Mortaigne, commanding them immediatlie vpon sight of
the same letters, to restore vnto king Richard all those castels,
cities, townes, lands, and other things, which they had taken from him
during the time of his remaining in captiuitie, and if they refused thus
to doo, then they gaue them to vnderstand by the same letters, that they
would aid king Richard to recouer that by force, which had beene
wrongfullie taken from him.</p>

the sonne of the earle of Henault, of all the which, and other mo, he
receiued homage, or rather had their promise by oth to aid him against
the French king, which French king, now that he sawe no hope nor
likelihood remaining to bring the emperour to the bent of his bowe for
the deteining of K. Richard still in captiuitie, raised a power

dooing, he granted eftsoones to stand to the truce, and so returned
home.</p>

<p>Finallie after king Richard had dispatched his businesse with the
emperour, and the princes of Almaigne, he set forward on his iournie
towards England, and hauing the emperours passeport, came to Cullen,
where he was ioifullie receiued of the archbishop, the which archbishop
attended on him till he came to Antwerpe, where king Richard tooke the
water in a gallie that belonged to Alane de Trenchmere, but in the night
he went into a ship of Rie, being a verie faire vessell, and so laie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
aboord in hir all the night, and in the morning returned to the gallie,
and so sailed about the coast, till he came to the hauen of Swin in
Flanders, and there staieng fiue daies, on the six day he set foorth
<span class="rightnote">He landed the 20. of March being sundaie as <i>R. Houeden</i><a name="FNanchor_6_11" id="FNanchor_6_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and

againe, and at length in good safetie landed at Sandwich the twelfe daie
of March, and the morrow after came to Canturburie where he was receiued
with procession, as Ger. Dor. saith. From thence he went to Rochester,
and on the Wednesday being the sixteenth of March, he came vnto London,
where he was receiued with great ioy and gladnesse of the people, giuing
heartie thanks to almightie GOD for his safe returne and deliuerance.</p>

<p>&para; It is recorded by writers, that when such lords of Almaine as came
ouer with him, saw the great riches which the Londoners shewed in that
triumphant receiuing of their souereigne lord and king, they maruelled
greatlie thereat, insomuch that one of them said vnto him; "Surelie oh
king, your people are wise and subtile, which do nothing doubt to shew
the beautifull shine of their riches now that they haue receiued you
home, whereas before they seemed to bewaile their need and pouertie,
whilest you remained in captiuitie. For verelie if the emperour had
vnderstood that the riches of the realme had bin such, neither would he
haue beene persuaded that England could haue b&eacute;ene made bare of wealth,
neither yet should you so lightlie haue escaped his hands without the
paiment of a more huge and intollerable ransome."</p>

<p>The same yeare that king Richard was taken (as before is mentioned) by
the duke of Austrich, one night in the moneth of Januarie about the
first watch of the same night, the northwest side of the element
appeared of such a ruddie colour as though it had burned, without any
clouds or other darknesse to couer it, so that the stars shined through
that rednesse, and might be verie well discerned. Diuerse bright strakes
appeared to
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" ></a><span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
flash vpwards now and then, diuiding the rednesse, thorough
the which the stars s&eacute;emed to be of a bright sanguine colour. In
Februarie next insuing, one night after midnight the like woonder was
s&eacute;ene, and shortlie after newes came that the king was taken in
Almaigne.</p>

<p>On the second daie of Nouember also a little before the breake of the
daie, the like thing appeared againe with lesse feare and woonder to the
people (than before) being now better accustomed to the like sight
againe. And now the same daie and selfe houre that the king arriued at
Sandwich, being the second houre of that daie, whilest the sunne shone
verie bright and cleare, there appeared a most brightsome and
vnaccustomed clearnesse, not farre distant from the sunne, as it were to
the length and breadth of a mans personage, hauing a red shining
brightnesse withall, like to the rainbow, which strange sight when manie
beheld, there were that prognosticated the king alreadie to be arriued.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> Diuerse sieges held at one time.</span>
In this meane while the bishop of Durham with a great armie besieged the
castell of Tickhill; and earle Dauid brother to the king of Scots, with
Ranulfe earle of Chester, and earle Ferrers, besieged the castell of
Notingham, whilest at the same present the archbishop of Canturburie
with a great power besieged Marleburgh castell, the which within a few
daies was rendred into his hands, the liues and lims of them within
saued. Also the castell of Lancaster was deliuered to him, the which the
same archbishops brother had in k&eacute;eping vnder earle John, and likewise
<span class="rightnote">S. Michaels mount.</span>
the abbeie of S. Michaels mount in Cornwall, the which abbeie Henrie de
la Pomerey chasing out the moonks, had fortified against the king, and
hearing newes of the kings returne home, died (as it was thought) for
m&eacute;ere gr&eacute;efe and feare. These three places were surrendered to the
archbishop before the kings returne, but Tickhill &amp; Notingham held out.</p>

<p>King Richard being returned into England, and vnderstanding both how the
French king made warre against him in Normandie, and that the state of
England was not a little disquieted, by the practise of his brother
earle John and his complices, speciallie by reason that diuerse castels
were defended by such as he had placed in them, he thought good with all
speed to cut off such occasions as might br&eacute;ed a<a name="FNanchor_6_12" id="FNanchor_6_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> further misch&eacute;efe.
<span class="rightnote">The king goeth to Notingham and winneth the castel.
<i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Wherevpon he first went to Notingham, and within thr&eacute;e daies after his
comming thither (which was on the daie of the Annunciation of our ladie)
he constreined them that kept the castell there in his brothers name, to
yeeld themselues simplie vnto his mercie, after they had abidden diuerse
assaults, by the which euen the first daie the vtter gates were burnt,
and certeine defenses destroied, which they had made before the same.</p>

<p>The cheefe of them that were within this castell to defend it were
these, William de Vendeuall conestable there, Roger de Mountbegun, Rafe
Murdach, Philip de Worceter and Ranulfe de Worceter, brethren. The morow
after the surrender was made, the king went to Clipstone, and rode into
<span class="rightnote">The forest of Shirewood.</span>
the forrest of Shirewood, where he had neuer b&eacute;ene before, the view
whereof pleased him greatlie. The castell of Tickhill was likewise at
the same time y&eacute;elded vnto the bishop of Durham, who receiued it to the
kings vse, and them that kept it as prisoners, without anie composition,
but standing simplie to the K. mercie. For although those that had these
castels in keeping, were sufficientlie prouided of all necessarie things
for defense, yet the sudden comming of the king (whom they thought
verelie would neuer haue returned) put them in such feare, that they
wist not what to make of the matter, and so (as men amazed) they y&eacute;elded
without anie further exception. The bishop of Durham bringing those
<span class="rightnote">The castel of Tickhill y&eacute;elded. <i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
prisoners with him which had y&eacute;elded vp this castell of Tickhill, came
to the king the 27 daie of March, the verie daie before that Notingham
castell was giuen ouer.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Strife betwixt y<sup>e</sup> archbishops for carieng of their crosses.</span>
Moreouer, this is to be remembred, that during the siege of Notingham,
contention arose betwixt the two archbishops of Canturburie and Yorke,
about the carriage of their crosses. For Hubert archbishop of
Canturburie comming thither, had his crosse borne before him; the
archbishop of Yorke (hauing no crosse there at all) was verie sore
offended, that anie other should go with crosse borne before him in his
diocesse, and therfore complained
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" ></a><span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
hereof to the king. But the
archbishop of Canturburie mainteined that he had not doone anie thing
but that which was lawfull for him to doo, and therevpon made his
appeale to Rome, that the pope might haue the hearing and iudging of
that controuersie betwixt them.</p>

<p>In the meane time, after the king had got the castells of Notingham and
Tickhill into his hands (as ye haue heard) he called a parlement at
Notingham, where the qu&eacute;ene mother sat on the right hand of him, and the
archbishops of Canturburie &amp; Yorke on the left, with other bishops,
earles and barons according to their places. On the first daie of their
<span class="rightnote">Officers discharged.</span>
session was Gerard de Camuille discharged of the office which he had
borne of shiriffe of Lincolne, and dispossessed both of the castell &amp;
countie. And so likewise was Hugh Bardolfe of the castell and countie of
Yorke, and of the castell of Scarbourgh, and of the custodie and k&eacute;eping
<span class="rightnote">Lieutenantships set on sale.</span>
of the countrie of Westmerland, the which offices being now in the kings
hands, he set them on sale to him that would giue most. Hereof it came
to passe, that where the lord chancellour offered to giue fift&eacute;ene
hundred markes before hand, for the counties of Yorke, Lincolne and
Northampton, and an hundred markes of increase of rent for euerie of the
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Yorks offer.</span>
same counties, Geffrey archbishop of Yorke offered to the king thr&eacute;e
thousand markes aforehand, onelie for the countie of Yorke, and an
hundred markes yearelie of increase, and so had the same committed to
his regiment.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Chester.</span>
Moreouer in this parlement, the king demanded iudgement against his
brother John, and Hugh Nouant the bishop of Couentrie and Chester, for
such traitorous and most disloiall attempts as they had made against him
and his countries, and iudgement was giuen that both the said earle and
bishop should haue summons giuen them peremptorilie to appeare, and if
within fortie daies after, they came not to answer such plaints as might
be laid against them, then should earle John forfeit all that he had
within the realme, and the bishop should stand to the iudgement of the
bishops, in that he was a bishop, and to the temporall lords in that he
had b&eacute;ene the kings shiriffe.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A subsidie.</span>
In this parlement also, in the kalends of Aprill, the king procured a
subsidie to be granted to him, to wit, two shillings of euerie plough
land through England, which maner of subsidie by an old name is called
Teemen toll, or Theyme toll. He also commanded that euerie man should
make for him the third part of knights seruice, accordinglie as euerie
f&eacute;e might beare, to furnish him foorth into Normandie. He demanded of
the moonks Cisteaux, all their wooles for the same yeare. But bicause
that seemed an ouer greeuous burthen vnto them, they fined with him, as
after shall appeare. The fourth day of this parlement, by the kings
permission manie greeuous complaints were exhibited against the
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Yorke accused.</span>
archbishop of Yorke, for extortion and other vniust vexations, which he
had practised: but he passed so little thereof, that he made no answer
vnto their billes.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Gerard de Camuille charged with felonie and treason.</span>
Moreouer through the procurement of the lord chancellour, Gerard de
Camuille was arreigned for receiuing th&eacute;eues, and robbers, which had
robbed certeine merchants of their goods, that were going to the faire
of Stamfort; also they appealed him of treason for refusing to stand to
his triall by order of the kings lawes at commandement of the kings
iustices, bearing himselfe to be earle Johns man, and aiding the same
earle against the king. But all these accusations he flatlie denied, and
so his aduersaries put in pledges to follow their suit, and he put in
the like to defend himselfe by one of his fr&eacute;eholders.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The king of Scots commeth to s&eacute;e the king of England.</span>
The same daie king Richard receiued the king of Scots at Clipstone,
comming now to visit him, and to reioise with him for his safe returne
home after so long a iournie, and so manie passed perils. After they had
spent the time a certeine space in ioy and mirth, the fourth of Aprill
at their being togither at Malton, the king of Scots required of king
Richard to haue restored to him the counties of Northumberland,
Cumberland and Westmerland, with the countie of Lancaster also, the
which in right of his predecessors belonged to him (as he alledged.)</p>

King Richard assembling a parlement of the Nobles of his realme at
Northampton, about sixt&eacute;ene daies after that the Scotish king had made

report that he did it for feare, and not for any loue or hartie

Elianor, and the lords spirituall and temporall of his realme togither
at that present assembled, granted and by his d&eacute;ed confirmed vnto the
said king of Scots, and to his heires for euer, that whensoeuer he or
any of them should come by summons of the king of England vnto his
court, the bishop of Durham, and the shiriffe of Northumberland should
receiue him at the water of Tw&eacute;ed, and safe conduct him vnto the water
of These, and there should the archbishop of Yorke, and the shiriffe of
Yorke be readie to receiue him of them, and from thence giue their
attendance vpon him vnto the borders of the next shire.</p>

<p>It was also granted to the said king, that he should be attended from
shire to shire by prelats and shiriffes, till he came to the kings
court, also from the time that the king of Scotland should enter this
realme of England, he should haue dailie out of the kings pursse for his
liuerie an hundred shillings, and after he came to the court, he should
haue an allowance dailie for his liuerie, so long as he there remained,
thirtie shillings and twelue manchet wastels, twelue manchet simnels,
foure gallons of the best wine, and eight gallons of houshold wine, two
pound of pepper, foure pound of cumin, two stone of wax, or else foure
links, and fortie great and long colpons of such candels as are serued
before the king, and foure and twentie colpons of other candels that
serue for the houshold. And when he should returne into his countrie
againe, then should he be conueied with the bishops and shiriffes from
countie to countie, till he come to the water of Tw&eacute;ed, hauing an
hundred shillings a day of liuerie, &amp;c: as is before appointed. The
charter of this grant was deliuered vnto William king of Scots in the
towne of Northampton, in Easter w&eacute;eke, by the hands of William bishop of
Elie lord chancellour, in the yeare of our lord 1194, and in the fift
yeare of king Richard his reigne.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A councell holden at Winchester.</span>
After this, on the fift&eacute;enth day of Aprill, king Richard hauing the said
king of Scots in his companie came to Winchester, where he called a
councell, and there in open assemblie he highlie commended all those of
the Nobilitie, that in his absence had shewed themselues faithfull, and
resisted his brother, and such other his complices, which had as
disloiall persons rebelled against him. Here he also proclaimed his said

tooke order for the punishment of them, that (being of their faction)
could by any means be apprehended.</p>

he caused himselfe to be eftsoones crowned by the archbishop Hubert, on

<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The king of Scots beareth one of the swords

presence of the said king of Scots, who bare one of the thr&eacute;e swords
before him, going in the middle betwixt two earles, that is to saie,
Hamelin earle of Warren going on his right hand, and Ranulfe earle of
Chester on his left. The canapie vnder the which he went was borne vp
also by foure earles, Norffolke, Lislewight, Salisburie, and Ferrers.
The bishop of Elie lord chancellour went on the right hand of the king,
and the bishop of London on the left. At dinner also the citizens of
<span class="rightnote">The citizens of London.</span>
London serued him in the butterie by reason of two hundred marks which
they had giuen the king that they might so doo, notwithstanding the
claime and challenge made by the citizens of Winchester, the which
serued him in the kitchin.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Yorke was commanded that he should not be present at
the coronation, least some tumult might arise about the hauing of his
crosse borne afore him, to
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" ></a><span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
the displeasure of the archbishop of
Canturburie, who stood in it, that no prelat within his prouince ought
to haue any crosse borne before him, himselfe excepted.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A parlement called.</span>
After this, he called a parlement, by vertue whereof he reuoked backe
and resumed into his hands all patents, annuities, f&eacute;es, and other
grants (before his voiage into the holie land) by him made, or otherwise
granted or alienated. And bicause it shuld not seeme that he vsed a
m&eacute;ere violent extortion herein, he treated with euerie one of them in
most courteous wise, bearing them in hand, that he knew well they ment
not to let foorth their monie to him vpon vsurie, but would be contented
with such reasonable gaine and profit, as had b&eacute;ene raised to their vse
in time of his absence of those things which they held of him by
assignation in way of lone, so that now the same might be restored to
him againe, sith he ment not to sell them, but to let them foorth as it
were to farme for the time, as all men might well vnderstand,
considering that he could not mainteine the port of a king without
receipt of those profits which he had so let foorth. With these gentle
<span class="rightnote">The bold courage of the bishop of Lincolne.</span>
words therefore mixed with some dreadfull allegations, he brought them
all into such perplexitie, that not one of them durst withstand his
request, nor alledge that he had wrong doone to him, except Hugh the
bishop of Lincolne, who sticked not to saie, that the king in this
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Durham lost his earledome.</span>
demand did them and the rest open iniurie. The bishop of Durham lost his
earledome, and was constreined to content himselfe with his old
bishoprike, and to leaue the dignitie of an earle, or at the leastwise
the possessions which he had bought of the king before his setting
forward into the holie land.</p>

<p>Thus the king recouered those things for the which he had receiued great
summes of monie, without making any recompense, where the most part of
the occupiers had not receiued scarselie a third part of the principall
which they had laid foorth. For no sufficiencie of grant, patent, or
other writing to any of them before made, did any thing auaile them.
<span class="rightnote">K. Richards practises. The moonks Cisteaux.</span>
Moreouer, where he had borrowed a great summe of monie of the merchants
of the staple, he wrought a feat with the moonks of the Cisteaux order
to discharge that debt. He told these moonks that being constreined with
vrgent necessitie, he had borowed that monie of the merchants beyond the
sea, vpon confidence of their good beneuolence, and therefore he
required them to extend their liberallitie so farre toward him, as to
deliuer so much wooll in value, as should discharge that debt. To be
short, the moonks being ouercome with the kings words, threatning
kindnesse vpon them, fulfilled his request. Moreouer not satisfied
herewith, he leuied a taske throughout the realme, exacting of euerie
hide of land two shillings, according to the grant made to him at
Notingham: and the same was generallie gathered, as well of the
spirituall mens lands as of the temporall.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The king of Scots maketh suit for

The king of Scots vnderstanding that the bishop of Durham had giuen ouer

herewith he began his former suit afresh, offering to king Richard
fift&eacute;ene thousand markes of siluer for the whole earledome of
Northumberland with the appurtenances, as his father earle Henrie did
hold the same before. The king taking counsell in the matter, agreed
that he should haue it for that monie, excepting the castels: but the
king of Scots would haue castels and all, or else he would not bargaine.</p>

<p>Finallie, after he had sundrie times mooued this suit for the hauing of
the lands vnto which he pretended a title, and could get nothing of king
Richard but faire words, putting him as it were in hope to obteine that
he required at his next returne out of France, vpon the 22 daie of
Aprill being fridaie, he tooke leaue of the king, and returned towards
his countrie, not verie ioifull, in that he could not obteine his suit.
King Richard in this meane while caused all those prisoners that were
taken in the castels of Notingham, Tickhill, Marleburgh, Lancaster<a name="FNanchor_6_13" id="FNanchor_6_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, and

they might fine for their ransoms. The residue he suffered to depart
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" ></a><span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
vpon suerties, that were bound for them in an hundredth marks a peece,
to be forth comming when they should be called.</p>

<p>Now the king (after he had gathered a great portion of monie, and
ordeined diuerse things for the behoofe of the common-wealth, thereby to
satisfie the harts of the people) prepared himselfe to saile into
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
Normandie. But first he reconciled the archbishop of Yorke, and the
bishop of Elie lord chancellour, aswell for the apprehension &amp;
imprisoning of the archbishop at Douer, as for the dishonourable
expulsion of the chancellour out of England, in such wise that the
chancellour should vpon reasonable summons giuen to him by the
archbishop, sware with the hands of an hundred pr&eacute;ests with him, that he
neither commanded nor willed that the archbishop should be apprehended.
The controuersie betwixt the two archbishops about the bearing of their
crosses, the king would not meddle withall, for (as he said) that
perteined to the pope. Yet the archbishop of Canturburie complained to
king Richard of the iniurie doone to him at that present by the
archbishop of Yorke, presuming within his prouince to haue his crosse
borne before him. At length when the kings prouision was once readie for
his voiage into Normandie, he came to Douer, and hearing that the French
king had besieged the towne of Vernueil, and that the same was in danger
to be taken, he tooke the sea togither with his mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor on
<span class="rightnote">The king transporteth ouer into France.</span>
the ninth daie of Maie, and transporting ouer into Normandie, arriued at
Harfl&eacute;et with an hundred great ships fraught with men, horsses and
armour.</p>

<p>The French king hearing of king Richards arriuall, and that he was
comming with a great power to the succour of them within Vernueil, and
<span class="rightnote">The French king raiseth his siege from Vernueil.</span>
was alreadie incamped n&eacute;ere to the towne of the Eagle, he plucked vp his
tents in the night before Witsundaie, and leauing the siege, departed
from thence, and tooke a certeine small fortresse by the waie as he
marched, wherein he left a few souldiers to keepe it to his vse. King
Richard herewith entring into the French dominions, sent three bands of
souldiers towards Vale de Ruell, and went himselfe vnto Loches, and
besieging that castell wan it within a short time. The Normans also
<span class="rightnote"><i>N.&nbsp;Triuet.</i></span>
recouered the citie of Eureux out of the French mens hands, but those
that were sent vnto Ruell, and had besieged the castell there an eight
daies without any gaine, hearing that the French king was comming
towards them, departed thence, &amp; came backe to the kings campe,
wherevpon the French king comming to Ruell raced it to the ground,
bicause his enimie should not at anie time in winning it nestle there to
the further damage of the countrie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
About the same time, Robert earle of Leicester issuing foorth of Rouen
in hope to worke some feat to the damage of the Frenchmen, as he rode
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Leicester taken prisoner.</span>
somewhat vnaduisedlie in the lands of Hugh Gourney, fell within danger
of his enimies, who tooke him prisoner, and a few other that were in his
companie. The French king after this came with his armie into the coasts
of Touraine; and marched neere Vandosme, and there incamped, whereof
king Richard being aduertised, drew n&eacute;ere to Vandosme, meaning to
assaile the French king in his campe, who hauing knowledge thereof
dislodged with his armie earlie in the morning, and fled awaie (to his
great dishonour) in all hast possible. The king of England with his
people following in chase of the Frenchmen slue manie, and tooke a great
number of prisoners, amongst whome was the French kings ch&eacute;efe
treasurer. Also the Englishmen tooke manie wagons and sumpters laden
with crossebowes, armour, plate, apparell, and the furniture of the
French kings chapell. This chanced about 37 daies after his fl&eacute;eing in
the night from Vernueil, of which two flights of the French king (in
manner as ye haue heard) we find these verses written:</p>

In this meane while certeine rebels in Guien, as the lord Geffrey de
Rancin<a name="FNanchor_6_14" id="FNanchor_6_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or Rancon, and the earle of Engolesme with their complices, vpon
confidence of the French kings assistance, sore disquieted the countrie.
Howbeit, the sonne of the king of Nauarre, and brother to Berengaria the
qu&eacute;ene of England, entring into Guien with an armie, wasted the lands of
both those rebels, till he was called home by reason of his fathers
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;6.</span>

died, and king Richard comming into his countrie, wan the strong castell

others, and then going against the other rebels, he wan the citie of
<span class="rightnote">Engolesme woone.</span>
Engolesme from him by force of assault. All which time the French king
stirred not, by reason that there was some communication in hand for a
truce to be taken betwixt him and king Richard, which by mediation of
certeine bishops was shortlie after concluded, to endure for twelue
moneths. The bishop of Elie was ch&eacute;efe commissioner for the king of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
England, and this truce was accorded about Lammas, and serued to little
purpose, except to giue libertie to either prince to breath a little,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
and in the meane time to prouide themselues of men, munition, ships &amp;
monie, that immediatlie after the terme was expired, they might with
greater force returne to the field againe, for they had not onelie a
like desire to follow the warres, but also vsed a like meane and
practise to leuie monie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Great exactions.</span>
For whereas they had alreadie made the temporaltie bare with often
paiments, and calling them foorth to serue personallie in the warres,
they thought best now to fetch a fleece from the spiritualtie and
churchmen, considering also that they had b&eacute;ene by reason of their
immunitie more gentlie dealt with, and not appointed to serue themselues
<span class="rightnote">The colour pretended in leuieng of monie.</span>
in anie maner of wise. To colour this exaction which they knew would be
euill taken of manie, they bruted abroad, that they leuied this monie
vpon purpose, to send it into the holie land, towards the paiment of the
christian souldiers, which remained there vpon defense of those townes,
which yet the Saracens had not conquered. King Richard therfore comming
to Towrs in Touraine, required a great summe of monie of the cleargie in
those parts, and the like request he made throughout all those his
dominions, on that further side of the sea. King Philip for his part
demanded likewise intollerable tithes and duties of all the churchmen in
his territories, and those that had the gathering of that monie serued
their owne turne, in dealing most streightlie with sillie pr&eacute;ests,
making them to paie what they thought good, though sometime beyond the
bounds of equitie and reason.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> Inquisitions taken by a iurie of sundrie

In September, the iustices itinerants made their circuits thorough
euerie shire and countie of this realme, causing inquisitions to be
taken by substantiall iuries of pl&eacute;es of the crowne both old and new, of
recognisances, of escheats, of wards, of mariages, of all maner of
offendors against the lawes and ordinances of the relme, and of all
other transgressors, falsifiers, and murtherers of Jewes; of the
pledges, goods, lands, debts, and writings of Jewes that were slaine,
and of other circumstances touching that matter. Likewise of the
accompts of shiriffes, as to vnderstand what had b&eacute;ene giuen towards the

receiue. Also of the lands that belonged to erle John, and what goods he
had, and what he held in demaine, in wards, escheats, and in gifts, and
for what cause they were giuen. Furthermore, of his fautors and
partakers, which had made fines with the king, and which not, with manie

an hundred shillings land or vnder, and of defaults, and of diuerse
other things, the iurats were charged to inquire, and present the same.</p>

<p>The iustices also were appointed to cause the manours, farmes and lands
which the king held in demaine, or by wards and escheats, to be surueied
by a substantiall iurie, and to take order for the conuerting of them to
such vse, as the king might be answered of the gaines rising by the same

inquisition was taken of iustices, shiriffes, bailiffes, conestables,

chancellour the
bishop of Elie, about concluding of the truce with the French king
(where as ye haue heard he was cheefe commissioner) misliking greatlie
all that was doone therein, and therefore he tooke the seale from him,
and caused a new seale to be made, commanding to be proclaimed thorough
all his dominions, that whatsoeuer had b&eacute;ene sealed with the old seale,
should stand in no force, both for that his chancellor had wrought more
vndiscreetlie than was conuenient; and againe, bicause the same seale
<span class="rightnote">A new seale.</span>
was lost, when Roger Malus Catulus his vicechancellour was drowned, who
perished, among other by shipracke, n&eacute;ere to the Ile of Cypres, before

<div class="blockquot"><h3>The tenour of the charter concerning the turnements before
remembred.</h3>

<p>Richard by the grace of God king of England, duke of Normandie and
Aquitaine, and earle of Aniou, to the reuerend father in Christ, Hubert
archbishop of Canturburie, and primat of all England, sendeth greeting.
Know ye that we haue granted turnaments to be kept in England in fiue
steeds, to wit, betwixt Sarisburie and Wilton, betwixt Warwike and
Kenelworth, betwixt Stanford and Warmeford, betwixt Brackley and
Nixburgh, betwixt Blie &amp; Tickhill, so that the peace of our land be not
broken, nor yet our iustices authoritie diminished, nor any damage doone
to our forrests. Prouided that what earle soeuer will turney there,
shall giue to vs twentie markes, a baron ten marks, a knight that hath
lands foure marks and he that hath no lands shall giue two marks.</p>

<p>Moreouer, no stranger shall be admitted to turney there, wherevpon we
command you, that at the daie of the turnieng, ye haue there two
clarkes, and two of our knights to receiue the oth of the earles and
barons, which shall satisfie vs of the said summes of monie, before the
turnieng begin, and that they suffer none to turnie, till (before) they
haue made paiment, and haue caused to be entred how much &amp; of whom they
haue receiued: and ye shall take ten marks for this charter to our vse,
whereof the earle of Salisburie, and the earle of Clare, and the earle
<span class="rightnote">Bishops towne.</span>
of Warren are pledges. Witnesse myselfe, at Ville Leuesche, the two and
twentith of August.</p>

</div>

<p>Furthermore, ordinances were made and set foorth for the safe keeping of
the peace, so that such as would turney, neither by the waie in comming
or going, or whilest the turnieng lasted, should violentlie take any
thing to serue their necessarie vses, without paieng therefore to the
owner according to the woorth, nor should doo iniurie to any man in any
manner of wise. But now to the other dooings of king Richard, who made
<span class="rightnote">I thinke he came not ouer at all into England at this time,
but rather sent his mind vnto the archbishop.</span>
no long abode in England at this time, but shortlie returned into
Normandie, bicause he heard that king Philip had an armie readie leuied.
Wherefore meaning to buckle with him vpon occasion offered, he made the
more hast, and being landed there, approched vnto the borders of the
French dominions, incamping himselfe with his armie in the field, to
wait for the time that the truce should be expired, least the enimie
should in any exploit preuent him. In like manner king Philip hauing
with him earle John king Richards brother, kept his souldiers and men of
warre in a readines with him, to worke any feat that should be thought
expedient assoone as the truce should end.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1195.</span>
Whilest both these kings were thus bent to powre out their malice, and
to ease their stomachs with dint of sword, there came messengers from
<span class="rightnote">Messengers from the pope.</span>
the pope, exhorting him vnto peace and quietnesse, but his exhortation
little auailed. For they regarding it little or nothing, immediatlie as
the truce was expired, got them abroad into the field, &amp; king Richard
<span class="rightnote">Isoldune.</span>
drew towards Isoldune, a towne situat in the confines of Berrie, whither
it was reported that the French king meant to come: and there staid for
him a whole day togither. But the French king hearing that king Richard
was there to looke for him, thought it best not to come there at all.
Wherefore king Richard went the next daie vnto a castell called Brison,
and tooke it vpon his first approch. Then went he to a towne called
Nouencourt and perceiuing the same to be strong and well manned, tooke
not in hand to assaile it till the third daie after his comming thither,
at what time he so
<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254" ></a><span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
inclosed the same round about with diligent watch
and ward, that a cat could not haue escaped out of the place, neither by
<span class="rightnote">Nouencourt y&eacute;eldeth to K. Richard. Albermarle besieged.
<i>Matt.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>Polydor.</i></span>
daie nor night, but that she should haue b&eacute;ene espied. They within being
put in feare herewith, yeelded vp the towne the daie next following, in
which meane time the French king besieged Albemarle.</p>

<p>Herevpon king Richard, hauing left a garrison of souldiers in
Nouencourt, came to raise the enimie from his siege, &amp; setting vpon the
Frenchmen, there began a sharpe fight: but the Englishmen being wearie
with trauell of their passed iournie, and hauing rashlie entred into the
battell, were not able to indure the Frenchmens violence, so that (not
without great losse) they were constreined to retire with swift flight,
or (to saie the truth) to run awaie a maine pase. The French king hauing
thus chased his enimies, returned to assault Albemarle, woone the
castell by force, and the towne by composition, permitting the garrison
there to depart with all their armour. This doone, he ruinated the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The earle of Leicesters offer for his ransome.</span>
castell flat to the ground. Robert earle of Leicester offered to the
French king a thousand marks sterling for his ransome, and to quite
claime to him and his heires for euer all the right which he had to the
castell of Pascie, with the appurtenances, and to get a confirmation
thereof for him both of the pope, and of the king of England: but for
that the warre still lasted, the French king tooke a respite in
answering this offer, neuerthelesse afterwards in the yeare next
insuing, he tooke it, and so the earle was set at libertie.</p>

<p>Not long after this foresaid repulse, the king of England hauing
refreshed his souldiers with some rest after their great trauell, went
<span class="rightnote">Million won and rased.</span>
to Million, and giuing assault to the towne wan it at the first brunt,
and made it plaine with the earth. Then was a motion made for peace
<span class="rightnote">A motion for peace.</span>
betwixt the two kings, being now wearied with long wars: whereof when
earle John was aduertised, who (as it should s&eacute;eme by some writers)
hauing tarried with the French king till this present, began now to
doubt least if any agr&eacute;ement were made, he might happilie be betraied of
the French king by couenants that should passe betwixt them: he
determined therefore with himselfe to commit his whole safetie to his
naturall brother, and to no man else, perceiuing that the French king
made not so great accompt of him after the losse of his castels in
England, as he had doone before.</p>

<p>Herevpon comming to his brother king Richard, "he besought him to pardon
his offense, and though he had not dealt brotherlie towards him, yet
that he would brotherlie forgiue him his rebellious trespasse, adding
furthermore, that whereas he had not heretofore beene thankefull for his
manifold benefits which he had receiued at his hands, yet he was now
most sorie therefore, and was willing to make amends: wherewith he
acknowledged the safegard of his life to rest in him, for the which he
was bound to giue him thanks, if he would grant thereto." The king
mooued with his words, made this answer (as it is said) that he pardoned
him ind&eacute;ed, but yet wished that he might forget such iniuries as he had
receiued at his hands, which he doubted least he should not easilie doo.
<span class="rightnote">Earle John returneth to the king his brother, and is
pardoned.</span>
Herewith erle John being yet put in good hope of forgiuenesse, sware to
be true euer after vnto him, and that he would endeuour himselfe to make
amends for his misdeeds past, and so was shortlie after restored vnto
his former degree, honour and estimation
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
in all respects.</p>

<p>But by some writers it should appeare, that earle John, immediatlie vpon
conclusion of the first truce, came from the French king, and submitted
himselfe to his brother, and by mediation of the qu&eacute;ene their mother was
pardoned, receiued againe into fauour, and serued euer after against the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
French king verie dutifullie, s&eacute;eking by new atchiued enterprises
brought about (to the contentation of his brother) to make a recompense
for his former misdemeanor, reputing it meere madnesse to make means to
further mischeefe; for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p class="nogap">
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
But at what time soeuer he returned thus to his brother, this yeare (as
Roger Houeden
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" ></a><span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
saith) he was restored to the earledoms of Mortaigne in
Normandie, and Glocester in England, with the honour of Eie (the castels
onelie excepted) and in recompense of the residue of the earledoms which
he had before inioied, togither with certeine other lands, his brother
king Richard gaue vnto him a yeerelie pension amounting to the summe of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Polychron.</i></span>
eight thousand pound of Aniouin monie. &para; Now here to staie a while at
matters chancing here about home, I will speake somewhat of the dooings
of Leopold duke of Austrich, who as one nothing mooued with the
pestilence and famine that oppressed his countrie in this season, but
rather hauing his hart hardened, began to threaten the English hostages
that they shuld loose their liues, if king Richard kept not the
couenants which he had vndertaken to performe by a day appointed.
<span class="rightnote">Baldwin de Betun.</span>
Wherevpon Baldwin Betun one of the hostages was sent by common agr&eacute;ement
of the residue vnto king Richard, to signifie to him their estate. King
Richard willing to deliuer them out of further danger, sent with the
same Baldwin his coosen, the sister of Arthur duke of Britaine, and the
daughter of the emperour of Cypres, to be conueied vnto the said duke of
Austrich, the one, namelie the sister of Arthur to be ioined in marriage
with the dukes sonne, and the other to continue in the dukes hands to
bestow at his pleasure.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Duke Leopold catcheth a fall beside his horsse and dieth of
the hurt.</span>
But in the meane time, on saint Stephans day, duke Leopold chanced to
haue a fall beside his horsse, and hurt his leg in such wise, that all
the surgions in the countrie could not helpe him, wherevpon in extreame
anguish he ended his life. And whereas before his death he required to
be absolued of the sentence of excommunication pronounced against him by
the pope (for apprehending of king Richard in his returning from his
iournie made into the holie land) he was answered by the cleargie, that
except he would receiue an oth to stand to the iudgement of the church
for the iniurie doone to king Richard, and that vnlesse other of the
Nobilitie would receiue the like oth with him if he chanced to die
(whereby he might not fulfill that which the church h&eacute;erein should
decr&eacute;e) that yet they should see the same performed, he might not
otherwise be absolued.</p>

<p>Wherefore he tooke the oth, and the Nobles of his countrie with him, and
therewithall released the English pledges, remitted the monie that yet
remained behind of his portion aforesaid, and immediatlie therewith
died. After his deceasse, bicause certeine p&eacute;eres of the countrie
withstood the performance of the premisses, his bodie laie eight daies
longer aboue ground than otherwise it should haue doone, for till such
time as all the pledges were perfectlie released, it might not be
buried. Also Baldwin de Betun approching neere to the confines of
Austrich, when he heard that the duke was dead, returned with the two
ladies vnto his souereigne lord king Richard. Thus (as ye haue heard)
for feare of the censures of the church were the pledges restored, and
the residue of the monie behind released.</p>

<p>&para; All this was both pleasant and profitable for king Richards soules
helth (as may be thought) bicause he tooke occasion therof to amend his
owne former life, by considering how much he might be reprehended for
his sundrie faults committed both against God and man. A maruellous
matter to heare, how much fr&#333; that time forward he reformed his
former trade of liuing into a better forme &amp; order. Moreouer, the
<span class="rightnote">White moonks.</span>
emperour gaue to the Cisteaux moonks 3000 marks of siluer, parcell of
king Richards ransome, to make siluer censers in euerie church
throughout where they had any houses: but the abbats of the same order
refused the gift, being a portion of so wrongfull and vngodlie a gaine.
At which thing, when it came to the knowledge of K. Richard, he greatlie
maruelled at the first, but after commended the abbats in their dooings,
and cheeflie for shewing that they were void of the accustomed
gr&eacute;edinesse of hauing, which most men supposed them to be much infected
withall.</p>

King Richard this yeare pardoned Hugh Nouant bishop of Couentrie of all
his wrath and displeasure conceiued toward him, and restored to him his
bishoprike for fiue thousand marks of siluer. But Robert Nouant the same
bishops brother died in the kings prison at Douer. Also whereas the

<span class="rightnote">Pope Celestine. The archbish. of Canturburie is made y<sup>e</sup>
popes legat.</span>
Moreouer, through the kings request, pope Celestine this yeare made the
archbishop of Canturburie legat of all England by his buls directed to
him, bearing date at his palace in Rome called Lateran the fifteenth
kalends of Aprill, in the fourth yeare of his papasie. Furthermore, the
pope wrote to the English cleargie, giuing them to vnderstand that he
had created the said archbishop of Canturburie his legat, commanding
them so to accept him: by vertue of which letters, the archbishop Hubert
<span class="rightnote">A trinitie of officers in vnitie of person.</span>
being now both archbishop of Canturburie, legat of the apostolike s&eacute;e,
and lord ch&eacute;efe iustice of England, appointed to hold a councell at
Yorke, and therefore gaue knowledge by the abbat of Binham in
Northfolke, and one maister Geruise, vnto the canons of Yorke, and to
the archbishops officials of his purposed intention.</p>

<p>The said canons and officials well considering of the popes letters,
which were deliuered vnto them by the messengers, signified for answer,
that they would gladlie receiue him as legat of the apostolike s&eacute;e, but
not as archbishop of Canturburie, nor as their primat. Herewith he came
to Yorke vpon saint Barnabies daie being sundaie, and was receiued with
procession. On the morrow after, he held a court of plees of the crowne,
of assises, and such other matters touching the king. On the next day
being Tuesday, he entred into the monasterie of saint Maries in Yorke,
and deposed the abbat, bicause of his infirmitie of bodie, at the
request of the moonks, but the abbat appealed to the popes consistorie.
<span class="rightnote">A synod holden at Yorke.</span>
Then he assembled the cleargie in the church of Saint Peter in Yorke,
and there held a synod for reformation of things amisse in the church,
and amendment of manners in the cleargie, so that diuerse decr&eacute;es were
made, the which for br&eacute;efenesse we omit to speake of in particular. This
yeare also, the said archbishop Hubert caused all men throughout the
realme of England to receiue an oth of obseruing the kings peace, and to
sweare that they should not be robbers, nor abbettors of robbers, nor in
any wise consenting vnto them, but should doo what in them might lie to
apprehend all such offendors, and to discouer them to the kings officers
to be apprehended, and to pursue them vpon hew and crie to the vttermost
of their powers, and those that withdrew themselues from such pursuit,
should be apprehended as partakers with the offendors.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The emperor sendeth to the king.</span>
About this time the emperour sent to king Richard, requiring him in no
wise to conclude any peace with the French king, but rather to inuade
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;7.</span>
his dominions, promising to aid him all that he might. But king Richard,
to vnderstand further of the emperours mind herein, sent ouer his
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Elie is sent to the emperour.</span>
chancellour the bishop of Elie vnto him in ambassage. In the meane time
the warre was still continued betwixt him and the French, by the which
they were commonlie put to the worse, and king Richard inuading their
borders, did much hurt in wasting the countries on each side. The French
king was at one time so narrowlie chased, that as he would haue passed a
bridge that laie ouer the water of Saine, he was in danger of drowning
by the fall of the same vnder him, but yet at the length he escaped, and
got to the further side.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The 2 kings talke togither.</span>
After this, the two kings came to a communication togither, in the which
a motion was made, that Lewes the French king his sonne and heire should
haue the sister of Arthur duke of Britaine in marriage, and that king
Richard in consideration thereof should surrender vnto them and to their
heires the townes of Gisors, Bademont, with the countrie of Veulquessine
or Veuxine le Normant, Vernon, Iuerie and Pascie; and further should
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" ></a><span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
giue vnto them twentie thousand marks of siluer. On the other side it
was mooued, that the French king should resigne vnto king Richard all
that he could demand in the countie of Engeulesme, and should restore
vnto him the counties of Albemarle and Augie, with the castell of Arkes,
and all other castels which he had taken in Normandie, or in any partie
during these last warres. But there was a respit taken for the full
concluding and assuring of these conditions, till the octaues of All
saints, that king Richard might vnderstand the emperours pleasure,
without whose consent he might not conclude any thing concerning that
matter, bicause he had sent such word vnto him by the lord chancellour,
who at this time was attendant in his court.</p>

<p>In the meane time, the emperour being aduertised of the whole matter,
and of the articles afore mentioned, gaue knowledge to king Richard by
the bishop of Elie at his returning backe, that this forme of peace
nothing liked him, but rather made directlie to his discontentment: the
which least he might s&eacute;eme to saie without sufficient ground of reason,
he alledged, that it should sound to king Richards dishonour, if he
surrendred and gaue vp anie thing that he had not in possession. And to
<span class="rightnote">The emperor dissuadeth the king from agr&eacute;eing to the peace.</span>
encourage him to recouer those things which had beene taken from him,
the emperour pardoned him of the seauent&eacute;ene thousand marks of siluer,
which yet remained behind due to him for the kings ransome. Howsoeuer
the matter passed, the two kings met not in the octaues of All saints,
according to the appointment, although they were come, and approched
verie n&eacute;ere to the place where they should haue communed togither: but
through the dissimulation of the Frenchmen, they departed, without
seeing one an other, and immediatlie began the warre as fiercelie as at
anie time before.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The warre is begun afresh.</span>
The French king tooke the towne of Diep, which king Richard had latelie
repared, and burned it, with the ships that harbored in the hauen: after
this, commming to Isoldun, he wan the towne and besieged the castell.
<span class="rightnote">The hast which king Richard made.</span>
But king Richard aduertised thereof, came with quicke sp&eacute;ed (making of
thr&eacute;e daies iournie but one) and entred into the castell of Isoldun to
defend the same against his aduersaries: and foorthwith there resorted
such numbers of men vnto him, when they heard how he was besieged, that
the French king doubting how to retire from thence in safetie, made suit
first to haue licence to depart, and after when that would not be
granted, he required at the leastwise to talke with the king of England
about some agr&eacute;ement.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The 2 kings againe talke togither of peace.</span>
Wherevnto king Richard condescended, and so comming togither, they
concluded vpon a truce to indure from that daie, being saturdaie next
after the feast of saint Nicholas, vnto the feast of saint Hilarie next
insuing, and then to m&eacute;et againe n&eacute;ere vnto Louiers with their councels,
that they might grow by some reasonable way vnto a finall peace and
concord. And according to this article, shortlie after the same feast of
<span class="yearnote">1196.</span>
S. Hilarie, they met at Louiers, where finallie they were accorded to
conclude a peace on these conditions, that the French king should

release to the king of England Isoldun, with the countrie about, woon by

had in Berrie, Auuergine, and Gascoigne, and the countie of Albemarle.
On the other part, the king of England should resigne Gisors, and
certeine other places, and namelie Veuxine or Veulquesine vnto the king
of France.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;West.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
Herevpon were suerties also bound for performance, and the forfeiture of
fift&eacute;ene thousand marks assigned to be paid by the partie that first
brake the peace. Shortlie after, the French king repenting him selfe of
the agreement, began to make a warre anew, so that king Richard seized
into his hands all the goods and<a name="FNanchor_6_15" id="FNanchor_6_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> possessions which belonged to the
abbats of the order of the great monasterie of Clunie, and of saint
Denise &amp; la Charitie, which had become suertie for the French king in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The earle of Albemarle departed
this life.</span>
the summe of 1500 marks aforesaid. This yeare died William de Forz earle
of Albemarle, in whose place succ&eacute;eded Baldwine de Betun by the kings
gift, and married the countesse of Albermarle.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Otho sonne to the duke of Saxonie.</span>
There was a motion also made for a marriage betwixt the lord Otho, sonne
to Henrie duke of Saxonie, king Richards nephue by his sister, and the
ladie Margaret, daughter to
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" ></a><span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
the king of Scots, so as they should haue
inioied the countries of Lothian, Northumberland, and the countie of
<span class="rightnote">Lawnes.</span>
Caerleill with the castels. For the conclusion of which marriage, the
archbishop of Canturburie was sent about Christmas to commune with the
king of Scots: but bicause the Scotish qu&eacute;ene was then conceiued of
child, hir husband (in hope that God would send him a sonne) refused to
stand vnto the aboue mentioned couenants.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> The abbat of Caen sent into
England.</span>
At this time king Richard sent the abbat of Caen (who was also the elect
of Durham) into England, to take an accompts of those that had the
receipts of the kings monie: for this abbat had informed the king, that
his receiuers and officers here in the realme dealt not iustlie in
making their accompts, but both deceiued the king, and oppressed his
people, in exacting more than was due,
<span class="rightnote">Fraudulent dealing in officers.</span>
and concealing that which they
ought to stand accomptable for. The king supposing his words to be true,
or at least likelie so to be, and that in reforming such vntruth in his
officers, it should be both profitable to him, and well liked of the
people, sent this abbat ouer with commission, to be as it were his
generall auditour.</p>

<p>Howbeit, Hubert archbishop of Canturburie, which was gouernour of the
realme in causes both temporall and spirituall (by reason he had the
kings authorise as his vicegerent, &amp; therefore sufficientlie
countenanced, &amp; also the popes as his legat authorised) did somewhat
stomach the matter, in that it should be thought he did suffer such
abuses in the kings officers, and not reforme them. But he held him
content and said little, sith the abbat shewed him the kings commission
to doo that which he went about, although he brought it not to passe.
For whereas he came ouer in lent, and gaue out commandements, that all
such as had any thing to doo in receipt of the kings monie, should
appeare before him after Easter, he tarried not to see Easter himselfe,
but was called into another world by the stroke of death, there to
render accompts for his owne acts here in this life committed.</p>

<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>Ran.&nbsp;Higd.</i> William
Fitz Osbert.</span>
At the same time there was another person in London called William with
the long beard, (ali&agrave;s Fitz Osbert) which had likewise informed the king
of certeine great oppressions and excessiue outrages vsed by rich men
against the poore (namelie the worshipfull of the citie, the Maior and
Aldermen) who in their hoistings, when any tallage was to be gathered,
<span class="rightnote">The foule disorder in the citizens of London.</span>
burdened the poore further than was thought reason, to ease themselues;
wherevpon<a name="FNanchor_6_16" id="FNanchor_6_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the said William being a seditious person, and of a busie
nature, ceassed not to make complaints. Now bicause the king gaue eare
vnto him at the first, he tooke a boldnesse thereof, &amp; drawing vnto him
great routs of the poorer sort of people, would take vpon him to defend
the causes of those that found themselues greeued with the heauie yoke
of richmen and gentlemen. He was somewhat learned, and verie eloquent:
he had also a verie good wit, but he applied it rather to set dissention
betwixt the high estates and the low, than to anie other good purpose.
He accused also his owne brother of treason, who in his youth had kept
<span class="rightnote">The vnnaturall ingratitude of Fitz Osbert.</span>
him to schoole, &amp; beene verie good and beneficiall brother vnto him,
bicause now he would not still mainteine him with monie to beare out his
riottous port. Moreouer, he declared to the king, that by extortion and
briberie of certeine men of great wealth, he lost manie forfeits and
escheats.</p>

<p>Manie gentlemen of honour sore hated him for his presumptuous attempts
to the hindering of their purposes: but he had such comfort of the king,
that he little passed for their malice, but kept on his intent, till the
king being aduertised of the assemblies which he made, commanded him to
ceasse from such dooings, that the people might fall againe to their
sciences and occupations, which they had for the more part left off, at
the instigation of this William with the long beard, so named of the
<span class="rightnote">Why he ware his long berd. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
long heare of his beard, which he nourished of purpose to seeme the more
graue and manlike, and also as it were in despite of them which
counterfeited the Normans (that were for the most part shauen) and
bicause he would resemble the ancient vsage of the English nation. The
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
kings commandement in restraint of the peoples resort vnto him, was well
kept a while, but it was not long yer they began to follow him againe as
they had doone before.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" ></a><span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
Then he tooke vpon him to make vnto them certeine collations or sermons,
taking for his theme, Haurietis aquas in gaudio de fontibus saluatoris,
<span class="rightnote">His oration to the people.</span>
that is to saie: Ye shall draw in gladnesse waters out of the founteins
of your sauiour. And hereto he added, "I am (said he) the sauiour of
poore men; ye be the poore, and haue assaied the hard hands and heauie
burdens of the rich: now draw ye therefore the healthfull waters of
vnderstanding out of my wels and springs, and that with ioy. For the
time of your visitation is come: I shall part waters from waters, by
waters I vnderstand the people, and I shall part the people which are
good and m&eacute;eke, from the people that are wicked and proud, and I shall
disseuer the good and euill, euen as light is diuided from darknesse."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
By these and such persuasions and means as he vsed, he had gotten two
and fiftie thousand persons, readie to haue taken his part, as appeared
after by a roll of their names found in his k&eacute;eping, besides diuerse
instruments of iron to breake vp houses, and other things seruing to
such like purposes. So that he brought the commoners into a great liking
of him: but the rich and wealthie citizens stood in much feare, so that
they kept their houses, in armes, in doubt to be robbed and murthred by
him in the night season.</p>

<p>The archbishop of Canturburie (vnto whome the rule of the realme
ch&eacute;efelie belonged) being aduertised hereof, sent for the greatest
number of the citizens, and vsing them with gentle words, persuaded them
to deliuer pledges, the better to assure him, that no such thing should
chance, which was suspected of manie, though he was loth to conceiue any
such opinion of them. They being ouercome with his courteous words, gaue
vnto him pledges.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">He is called before the archbishop of Canturburie lord ch&eacute;efe
iustice or president of the realme.</span>
After this, when the foresaid William ceased not to make congregations
of the people, at length the archbishop sent a commandement vnto him,
that he should appeare before him and other of the councell, at a
certeine prefixed daie, to answer to such things as might be laid to his
charge. To be short, he did so at the time appointed, but with such a
rout of the common people about him, that the archbishop durst not
pronounce against him, but licenced him to depart for that time, giuing
him soft and gentle words. Howbeit, certeine persons were then appointed
by the said archbishop and other of the councell to watch him sometime,
when he should haue no great companie about him, and then to apprehend
him.</p>

<p>Amongst those that were thus commanded to attach him, were two burgesses
of the citie, who hauing espied a conuenient time for the execution of
their purpose, set vpon him to haue take him, but he getting an ax,
defended himselfe manfullie: and in resisting slue one of them, and
<span class="rightnote">He fl&eacute;eth into the church of S. Marie Bow.</span>
after that fled into the church of S. Marie Bow, k&eacute;eping the same not as
a place of sanctuarie, but as a fortresse: in somuch that by the help of
such as resorted vnto him, he defended it against his aduersaries, till
with fire and smoke they constreined him to come foorth, and all those
<span class="rightnote">His concubine.</span>
that were there with him: amongst them also was his concubine, who neuer
left him for any danger that might betide him.</p>

<p>The people regarding the danger of their pledges, came not out to aid
him, as it was much doubted they would haue doone. Wherefore being thus
attached, he was brought foorth, and comming out of the church, the
sonne of that burgesse whome he had slaine (as you haue heard) strake
him verie sore into the bellie with a knife, in reuenge of his fathers
death. After this, he was had to his arraignment before the archbishop,
sitting within the towre, and being condemned, was from thence drawne
with horsses to the place of execution called the Elmes, and there
<span class="rightnote">He is executed.<br />
<i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
hanged on a gibet, with nine of his adherents, which had defended the
church against the kings power: and yet for all this, the grudge ceassed
not, but the common people raised a great slander vpon the archbishop,
both for causing him to be taken out of the church, where he claimed
<span class="rightnote">The archbishop of Canturburie is euill spok&#275; of for y<sup>e</sup>
death of William Fitz Osbert.</span>
priuilege of sanctuarie, and also for putting him to death, who was
innocent (as they alledged) and not giltie of those crimes that were
laid against him: who sought onelie the defense of poore people against
extortioners, and such as were wrong dooers.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" ></a><span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
This rumor rose so fast, that at length (by bruting abroad, that
certeine miracles should be wrought by a chaine, wherein he was bound in
<span class="rightnote">An old whormonger, and a new saint.</span>
time of his imprisonment) he was taken for a saint. The place also where
he suffered, was visited by women, and other superstitious folks, as a
plot of great holinesse, till at length the archbishop caused it to be
watched, to the end that no such foolishnesse should be vsed there. In
fine, the opinion which the people had thus fondlie conceiued of his
vertue and innocencie, was by little and little remooued out of their
heads, when his acts were more certeinelie published: as the sleaing of
a man with his owne hands, and the vsing of his concubine within Bowe
church, during the time of his being there. Also the archbishop accursed
a pr&eacute;est, which had first brought vp the false report and fained fable
of the miracle wrought by the chaine, whereby the occasion of idolatrie
was first giuen, and might easilie haue b&eacute;ene continued, if the
archbishop had not b&eacute;ene the wiser man, and by such means repressed the
rumour. &para; So that we are to note by this example the force of
counterfeit holinesse and feigned harmelesnesse in hypocrits,</p>

<p>But now to return vnto the dooings of king Richard in France. Ye haue
heard how a peace was concluded (as some haue written) but the same
continued not long: for the French king s&eacute;eming to repent himselfe of
that he had doone (as is aforesaid) brake the peace, and raising a
power, besieged Albemarle; at length wan it, and raced it downe to the
ground, then king Richard gaue vnto him thr&eacute;e thousand marks of siluer
for the ransome of his knights and yeomen, or demilances (as I may call
them) that were taken in that fortresse. After this, the French king wan
Nouencourt, and earle John tooke the castell of Gamages.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The erledome of Poictou.</span>
About the same time also king Richard gaue vnto his nephue Otho the
earledome of Poictou. Which I haue thought good to note out of Roger
Houeden, to remooue the doubt of Iohn Bouchet,
<span class="rightnote">John Bouchet his dout.</span>
who in the third part of
his annales of Aquitaine, maruelleth at an old panchart or record which
he had s&eacute;ene, by the tenour whereof it appeared, that this Otho
intituled himselfe duke of Aquitaine and earle of Poictou, being in his
castell of Monstereulbonin neere to Poictiers, in the yeare a thousand,
one hundreth, ninetie nine, in presence of Geffrey de Lusignen, and
others, and granted vnto a certeine person the office of cutting the
monie in the mint of that towne, as by the same panchart it further
appeareth.</p>

<p>The sight whereof brought the said Bouchet into a great perplexitie,
considering that no chronicle which he had either seene, or heard of,
made mention of any Otho that shuld be duke of Aquitaine, or erle of
Poictou, either before that time, or after. Where againe it was euident
to him, that queene Elianor the mother of king Richard, as then liuing,
named hir selfe dutchesse of Aquitaine, and countesse of Poictou; &amp;
likewise king Richard intituled himselfe duke of Aquitaine, and earle of
Poictou, euer after he had fianced the earle of Barcelons daughter, as
by diuerse records both of the mother and the sonne he had s&eacute;ene perfect
notice. At length yet he gesseth (and that trulie) that it should be
this Otho, to whom the mother and sonne had assigned the dutchie of
Aquitaine and countie of Poictou, for the maintenance of his estate, he
holding the same till the yeare 1199, in the which he was made emperour
by king Richards good helpe, as after shall be shewed more at large.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Ranulph erle of Chester tooke his wife the dutchesse of
Britaine prisoner.</span>
About this time also as the countesse of Britaine, the mother of duke
Arthur came into Normandie to haue spoken with king Richard, Ranulph
earle of Chester hir husband meeting hir at Pountourson, tooke hir as
prisoner, and shut hir vp within his castell at S. James de Beumeron:
and when hir sonne Arthur could not find means to deliuer hir out of
captiuitie, he ioined with the king of France, and made great hauocke in
the lands
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" ></a><span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
of his vncle king Richard, wherevpon the king gathered a
mightie armie, and inuading Britaine with great force, cruellie wasted
and destroied the countrie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">A dearth.</span>
Here is also to be noted, that in this seuenth yeare of king Richard, a
great dearth chanced through this realme of England, and in the coasts
about the same. Also about the same time died William earle of
<span class="rightnote">The death of the earle of Salisburie.</span>
Salisburie, the sonne of earle Patrike, whose daughter and heire king
Richard gaue in marriage, togither with the earledome of Salisburie,
vnto his base brother, surnamed Long Esp&eacute;e.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
It chanced moreouer about the same time, that earle John the kings
brother, with certeine capteins of such hired souldiors as some call
Brabanceni; others, the Routs; and the French histories name them
Costereaux, or Coterels, went abroad to atchiue some enterprise against
the bishop of Beauuois, and other Frenchmen, which had doone much hurt
to king Richards subiects in those parties. The ch&eacute;efe leaders of those
Routs or Costereaux, which went foorth with earle John, and serued vnder
<span class="rightnote">Marchades &amp; Lupescaro.</span>
him at that time, were two Prouancois, Marchades &amp; Lupescaro. These
riding foorth into the countrie about Beauuois made hauocke in robbing
and spoiling all afore them.</p>

<p>Anon as Philip the bishop of Beauuois, a man more giuen to the campe
than to the church, had knowledge hereof, thinking them to be a m&eacute;et
preie for him, with sir William de Merlow and his sonne, and a great
number of other valiant men of warre, came foorth into the fields, and
encountring with the enimies, fought verie stoutlie. But yet in the end
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Beauuois taken prisoner.</span>
the bishop, the archdeacon, and all the ch&eacute;efe capteins were taken: the
residue slaine and chased. After this, earle John and the foresaid
capteins passed foorth, and wan the towne of Millie, and so returned.</p>

<p>Earle John and Marchades presented the two prelats with great triumph
vnto K. Richard earlie in the morning, lieng yet in his bed; as those
that were knowne to be his great enimies, saieng to him in French; "Rise
Richard, rise, we haue gotten the great chantour of Beauuois, and a good
quier man (as we take it) to answer him in the same note, and here we
deliuer them vnto you to vse at your discretion." The king s&eacute;eing them,
smiled, and was verie glad for the taking of this bishop, for that he
had euer found him his great aduersarie: and therefore being thus taken
fighting in the field with armour on his backe, thought he might be bold
in temporall wise to chastise him: sith he (not regarding his calling)
practised to molest him with temporall weapons: wherevpon he committed
him to close prison all armed as he was.</p>

<p>It chanced soone after, that two of his chaplins came vnto the king to
Rouen, where this bishop was deteined, beseeching the king of licence to
attend vpon their maister now in captiuitie: vnto whome (as it is of
some reported) the king made this answer; "I am content to make you
iudges in the cause betwixt me and your maister, as for the euils which
he hath either doone, either else gone about to doo vnto me, let the
same be forgotten. This is true, that I being taken as I returned from
my iournie made into the holie land, and deliuered into the emperours
hands, was in respect of my kinglie state, vsed according therevnto
verie fr&eacute;endlie and honourablie, till your maister comming thither (for
what purpose he himselfe best knoweth) had long conference with the
emperour. After which, I for my part in the next morning tasted the
fruit of their ouernights talke, being then loden with as manie irons as
a good asse might not verie easilie haue borne. Iudge you therefore,
what maner of imprisonment your maister deserued at my hands, that
procured such ease for me at the emperours hands."</p>

<p>The two chaplins had their mouths stopped with these words thus by the
king vttered, and so departed their waies. The bishop being still
deteined in prison, procured suit to be made to the pope for his
deliuerance: but the pope, being truelie informed of the matter, and
wiselie considering that the king had not taken the bishop preaching,
but fighting, and kept him prisoner rather as a rough enimie, than as a
peaceable prelat, would not be earnest with the king for his
deliuerance, but rather reprooued the bishop, in that he had preferred
secular warfare before the spirituall, and had taken vpon him the
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262" ></a><span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
vse
of a speare in st&eacute;ed of a crosier, an helmet in steed of a miter, an
herbergeon in st&eacute;ed of a white rochet, a target for a stoale, and an
iron sword in lieu of the spirituall sword: and therefore he refused to
vse any commandement to king Richard for the setting of him at libertie.
But yet he promised to doo what he could by waie of intreating that he
might be released.</p>

<p>It is reported by some writers, that the pope at first, not
vnderstanding the truth of the whole circumstance, should send to king
Richard, commanding him by force of the canons of the church to deliuer
his sons the bishop and archdeacon out of their captiuitie. To whom the
king sent their armour with this message written in Latine, "Vide an
<span class="rightnote"><i>Genes. 37.</i></span>
tunica filij tui sit an non," that is, "See whether these are the
garments of thy sonnes or not:" alluding to the saieng of those that
caried Josephs coate to Jacob. Which when the pope saw, he said: "Naie
by S. Peter, it is neither the apparell of my sonnes, nor yet of my
brethren: but rather they are the vestures of the children of Mars:" and
so he left them still to be ransomed at the kings pleasure. The bishop
thus s&eacute;eing no hope to be deliuered without some agr&eacute;ement had betwixt
the two kings, became now through irkesomenesse of his bonds, an earnest
mediatour for peace, whereas before he had beene an extreme stirrer vp
of war. Such a schoolemaister is imprisonment, &amp; plucker downe of loftie
courages. But to proceed.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;8.</span>
About the same time the archbishop of Rouen put all the countrie of
Normandie vnder sentence of interdiction, bicause king Richard had begun
<span class="rightnote">Normandie interdicted by y<sup>e</sup> archbishop of Rouen.</span>
to fortifie a castell at Lisle Dandelie, vpon a p&eacute;ece of ground which
the archbishop claimed to apperteine vnto his s&eacute;e. The matter was
brought before the pope, who perceiuing the intent of king Richard was
not otherwise grounded vpon any couetous purpose to defraud the church
of hir right, but onelie to build a fortresse in such place as was most
expedient for defense of the countrie about, to preserue it from
inuasion of the enimies; he counselled the archbishop not to stand
against the king in it, but to exchange with him for some other lands:
which was doone, and the interdiction by the pope released. The bishop
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Elie departed this life.</span>
of Elie lord chancellour, being sent about this businesse towards Rome,
departed this life by the way at Poictiers, in Januarie.</p>

<p>But the bishops of Durham &amp; Lisieux that were sent with him, passed
forward, and comming to Rome, informed the pope of the matter, who tooke
order with the bishops (as before is mentioned.) The king gaue to the
church in Rouen in recompense, his milles which he had in Rouen, so that
the said church should paie the almes of old time appointed to be giuen
for the same. He gaue to the said church likewise the towne of Diepe,
and the towne of Bussels, so that the church should likewise paie the
almes assigned foorth of the same, being the summe of 372 pounds of
Aniouine monie: also the manour of Louers, and the forrest of Alermound
with the deere and the appurtenances. But now to other dooings.</p>

<p>About the same time, or not long before, whereas there had beene long
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The king and the earle of Tholouse agr&eacute;ed.</span>
contention betwixt the kings of England, and the earles of S. Giles for
the earldome of Tholouse, king Richard by way of aliance fell now at an
appointment with the earle Raimond that held those lands; for whereas
the countesse Constance wife to the said Raimond earle of Tholouse and
aunt to king Philip was now departed this life, king Richard concluded a
mariage betweene the said earle and his sister Joane qu&eacute;ene of Sicile,
sometime wife to William king of Sicile, so that being thus ioined in
aliance with the said earle of Tholouse on the one side, he procured a
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt.&nbsp;Paris.</i> The earle of Flanders alied with K. Richard.
<i>Iacob.&nbsp;Meir.</i> <i>Les annales de France.</i></span>
league also with Baldwine earle of Flanders on the other, vnto whom he
gaue fiue thousand markes in reward, vpon condition, that he should
couenant not to grow to any agr&eacute;ement with the French king without his
consent. Likewise Reginold the earle of Bolongne, that was sonne to
earle of Chateau Marline, alied himselfe with them against the French
king, and so did Baldwine earle of Guines with diuerse other.</p>

<p>Thus King Richard by such aliance hauing his part greatlie strengthened,
prepared
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" ></a><span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
himselfe to the warre more earnestlie than before, and tooke
order with the earle of Flanders, that they should inuade the French
dominions in two seuerall quarters both at one time, as the earle by
Flanders, &amp; he himselfe by Normandie, according to the appointment
<span class="rightnote"><i>Iacob.&nbsp;Meir.</i> <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i> Towns won by the earle of
Flanders.</span>
betwixt them deuised. The earle preparing an armie, first wan the towne
of Dowaie, and then besieged saint Omers, and wan it after fiue weekes
siege: wherevpon they of Aire yeelded to him; shortlie after he entred
into Artois, &amp; besieged the citie of Arras.</p>

<p>At the same time king Richard marching towards Gisors, wan in his waie
<span class="rightnote">Gisors besieged.</span>
the castell of Corselles, &amp; destroied it; that doone, he came to Gisors,
and besieged the towne, wasting all the countrie round about him where
he came. The French king being thus troubled with the inuasion of his
enimies in two seuerall places at one present time, sent certeine bands
of his souldiors towards Arras to k&eacute;epe the earle of Flanders plaie,
whilest he himselfe went against king Richard: and comming vnto Gisors,
found it streictlie besieged of the same king, so that he wist not well
how to enter the towne. But yet at length faigning to giue battell to
king Richard (who vpon desire to receiue it, came abroad into the field)
the French king rushed foorth with all his whole force to make towards
<span class="rightnote">The French king entreth into Gisors.</span>
the towne, &amp; so got into it, though not without great losse and damage
of his people.</p>

<p>King Richard not meaning to breake vp his siege from before the towne,
(notwithstanding the French king had entred it) staied a certeine time
of purpose to win it, knowing the gaine to be the greater, and his name
more famous, if he might atchiue his purpose, now that his aduersarie
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard raiseth his siege.</span>
was within it, but when he saw it would not be, he raised his siege, and
departed towards Cleremont, spoiling all the countrie by his forrais as
he went, so that he wan great pillage, wherewith his souldiers were
loden and made verie rich.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Hugh de Cheaumount taken prisoner.</span>
It chanced, that in a skirmish Hugh de Chaumount was taken prisoner, one
that was of the French kings priuie councell; and king Richard appointed
him to the k&eacute;eping of Robert Ros, who charged one of his seruants named
William de Spinie with the custodie of him. But the said Hugh corrupting
his k&eacute;eper the foresaid William with rewards, (whereof it is said,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="nogap">
<span class="rightnote">Robert Rosse put to his fine for an escape.</span>
escaped out of the castell of Bonneuille, where he was within ward, to
the great displeasure of king Richard, who caused Robert Ros to paie for
a fine, the summe of twelue hundred marks, which the prisoner should
haue paied for his ransome: and further, commanded William de Spinie to
be hanged for his disloiall dealing.</p>

<p>King Philip, after that the king of England was remooued from Gisors (as
before y&eacute;e haue heard) assembled a great host, and with banner
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
displaied, entred into Normandie, and wasted the countrie from Newburge
to Beaumont le Rogier, and that doone, returned into France, licencing
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nic.&nbsp;Treuet.</i> The French kings request for a combat.</span>
his men to returne vnto their homes. About the same time, he sent vnto
king Richard, requiring him to appoint fiue champions, and he would
appoint other fiue for his part, which might fight in lists, for triall
of all matters in controuersie betwixt them, so to auoid the shedding of
<span class="rightnote">K. Richards answer.</span>
more giltlesse bloud. King Richard accepted the offer, with condition,
that either king might be of the number, that is, the French king one of
the fiue vpon the French part; &amp; K. Richard one of the fiue vpon the
English part. But this condition would not be granted. Herevpon when
<span class="yearnote">1197.</span>
shortlie after it was signified to king Richard, that ships vsed to come
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
out of England to saint Valerie with victuals, which were sold and
conueied awaie vnto the French K and other his enimies, he rode to saint
Valeries, and set the towne on fire, and such ships of England as he
<span class="rightnote">Ships burnt, and mariners hanged.</span>
found there he also burnt, and hanged the mariners by the necke,
diuiding the graine and other victuals which were found in the same
ships amongst his owne souldiors.</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" ></a><span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Les annales de France.</i></span>
About the same time he got the fauour of them of Champaigne and of the
Britons, and William Crespine also was constreined to deliuer vnto him
the castell of Auge, but the French king recouered it by siege, whilest
king Richard entring into Aluergne wan diuerse castels there, to the
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;9.</span>
number of ten out of king Philips hands. In the meane time the earle of
Flanders made sore war against the French king for his part, and
training the same king within streits, so that he was almost inclosed on
ech side, he constreined him to agr&eacute;e to such composition as pleased the
same earle to appoint, but afterwards the French king refused to stand
to the couenants of that agr&eacute;ement, and so the warre continued betwixt
them as before.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> One yeare &amp; 4 moneths saith <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
At length king Richard and the French king concluded vpon an abstinence
of warre to indure from the feast of S. Hilarie for one whole yere,
purposing in the meane time to make a finall peace and agr&eacute;ement. In
which season Baldwine earle of Flanders came into England to doo his
deuotions vnto the shrine where Thomas the archbishop laie buried at
Canturburie. The same yeare also somewhat before this time, Rise ap
<span class="rightnote">Griffin king of Wales departed this life.</span>
Griffin king of Wales departed this life, after whose death there fell
discord betwixt his sonnes for the succession, till the archbishop
Hubert went to the marshes of that countrie and made an agr&eacute;ement
betwixt them. Not long after, Roger the brother of Robert earle of
Leicester, elected bishop of saint Andrews in Scotland, receiued the
order of pr&eacute;esthood, and was consecrated bishop by the hands of the
bishop of Aberdine.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Weights and measures.</span>
This yeare it was ordeined that measures of all manner of graine should
conteine one quantitie throughout the realme, that is to saie, one
resonable horsselode, and that the measures of wine and ale with all
maner of liquors should be of one iust quantie according to the
diuersitie of the liquor: also that weights should be of like rate
throughout the relme, and that cloth should conteine two yards in
breadth within the lists, of perfect goodnesse throughout, as well in
the middest as by the sides, and that one manner of yard should be vsed
through the relme. It was also ordeined that no merchants within the
realme should hang any red or blacke clothes before their windowes, nor
set vp any pentises or other thing whereby to darken the light from
those that came to buy their cloth, so as they might be deceiued in
choosing thereof.</p>

<p>Also it was enacted that there should be foure or six substantiall
honest men chosen in euerie towne, and likewise in shires, with the head
officers of cities and boroughes, which had a corporation, to see that
the assises aforesaid were truelie kept, and that if anie were found to
be offending in the premisses, to cause their bodies to be attached and
commited to prison, and their goods to be seized to the kings vse: and
if those that were chosen to haue regard thereto, were tried to be
negligent, so that by others, and not by them any offenders chanced to
be conuicted before the iustices, then should the regarders be put to
their fines, for the negligent looking to their offices.</p>

<p>King Richard held his Christmasse this yeare at Roan, and Hubert the
<span class="yearnote">1198.</span>
archbishop of Canturburie legat of the apostolike s&eacute;e, named lord ch&eacute;efe
Justice of England, was about the same time in the marshes of Wales at
Hereford, and there receiued into his hands the castels of Hereford,
Bridgenorth and Ludlow, remoouing those that had the same in k&eacute;eping,
and appointing others in their roomes. Afterwards comming by Couentrie,
<span class="rightnote">Moonks placed againe in the church of Couentrie.</span>
he placed the moonks againe in the cathedrall church of that citie, by
commandement of pope Celestine, and chased out the secular canons, which
the bishop Hugh Nouant had brought into the same church when he remooued
the moonks.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Messengers from the stats of Germanie.</span>
In the Christmasse w&eacute;eke also there came messengers to Rouen from the
archbishops of Cullen and Mentz, and from other states of the empire,
which declared vnto king Richard, that all the princes of Germanie were
appointed to assemble at Cullen, the two &amp; twentith of Februarie, about
the choosing of a new emperour, in place of the late deceassed Henrie:
and therefore they commanded him by force of the oth and league in which
he was bound to the emperour and empire, that all excuse of deniall or
occasions to the contrarie ceasing and set apart, he should make his
repaire vnto Cullen at the aforesaid day, to helpe them in choosing of
some worthie personage that might and was
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" ></a><span class="pagenum">[265]</span>
able to haue the empire. King
Richard doubting to put himselfe in danger, bicause he had not
discharged all the debts due for his ransome, staied at home, but yet he
sent diuerse noble men thither, and did so much in fauour of his nephue
Otho, that by the helpe of the foresaid two archbishops of Cullen and
Mentz, the same Otho was elected emperour. But of this matter more shall
be said hereafter.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Three hundred knights of men of armes to be found.</span>
Moreouer, about the same time king Richard required by the archbishop of
Canturburie his ch&eacute;efe iustice, an aid of 300 knights to be found by his
subiects of England, to remaine with him in his seruice for one whole
yeare, or else that they would giue him so much monie, as might serue to
reteine that number after the rate of thr&eacute;e shillings a daie of English
monie for euerie knight. Whereas all other were contented to be
<span class="rightnote">The bishop of Lincolne.</span>
contributors herein, onelie Hugh bishop of Lincolne refused, and spake
sore against the archbishop that moued the matter. But how soeuer that
request tooke place, king Richard (as we find) leuied this yeare a
subsidie of fiue shillings of euerie hide of land within the realme, two
commissioners, that is to say, one of the spiritualtie, &amp; a knight of
the temporaltie, being appointed as commissioners in euerie shire, with
the assistance of the shiriffe, and others, to s&eacute;e the same assessed &amp;
rated after an hundred acres of land to the hide of land, according to
the custome.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The moonks of Christes church send to the pope, complaining
of their archbishop.</span>
The same yeare also the moonks of the house of the holie Trinitie,
otherwise called Christes church in Canturburie, exhibited their
complaint vnto pope Innocent, that their archbishop Hubert (contrarie to
his order and dignitie) exercised the office of high iustice, and sate
in iudgement of bloud, being so incumbred in temporall matters, that he
could not haue time to discharge his office touching spirituall causes:
<span class="rightnote">The pope sendeth to the king.</span>
wherevpon the pope sent vnto king Richard, admonishing him not to suffer
the said archbishop to be any longer troubled with temporall affaires,
but to discharge him thereof, and not to admit any spirituall person
from thencefoorth vnto any temporall administration.</p>

<p>He further prohibited by vertue of their obedience, all manner of
prelats and men of the church, that they should not presume rashlie to
take vpon them any maner of secular function or office. Whervpon the
archbishop was discharged of his office of ch&eacute;efe iustice, and Geffrey
Fitz Peter succ&eacute;eded in gouernement of the realme in his st&eacute;ed. &para;
Geruasius Dorobernensis saith, that the archbishop resigned that office
of his owne accord, and that not till after his returne from the marshes
of Wales, where he had ouerthrowne the Welshmen, and slaine fiue
thousand of them. Which victorie other ascribe vnto Geffrey Fitz Peter,
which Geffrey (as the said Dorobernensis saith) succeeded the archbishop
in the office of lord cheefe iustice, but not vntill August, in the
tenth yeare of the kings reigne.</p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">An.&nbsp;Reg.&nbsp;10.</span>
In this yeare, immediatlie vpon the expiring of the truce which was
taken till haruest might be ended, the warre betwixt the two kings of
England &amp; France began eftsoones to be pursued with like earnestnesse as
before: wherevpon manie encounters chanced betwixt the parties, with
taking of townes and fortresses, as commonlie in such cases it
happeneth. Twise the French king was put to the worsse, once in
September betwixt Gamages and Vernon, where he was driuen to saue
himselfe by flight, loosing twentie knights, and thr&eacute;escore seruitors or
yomen, which were taken, besides those that were slaine: and againe, in
the same moneth on Michaelmasse euen betwixt Curseilles and Gisors, at
what time he came to succour Curseilles, bringing with him 400 knights,
besides seruitors, and a great multitude of commons. But the castell was
woone before he could approch it.</p>

<p>King Richard being aduertised of his comming, hasted foorth to m&eacute;et him,
and giuing the onset vpon him, forced him to fl&eacute;e vnto Gisors, where at
the entring of the bridge there was such preasse, that the bridge brake,
so that amongst other, the king himselfe with his horsse and all fell
<span class="rightnote">King Philip almost drowned.</span>
into the riuer of Geth, and with much adoo was releeued, and got out of
the water, no small number of right hardie and valiant gentlemen being
taken at the same time, which put themselues forward to staie the
Englishmen, till the king was recouered
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" ></a><span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
out of the present danger. To
conclude, there were taken to the number of an hundred knights, and two
<span class="rightnote">Seuen score saith <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i> <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
hundred barded horsses, besides seruitors on horssebacke, and footmen

Montmorancie, Gales de Ports, Iollen de Bray, and manie other also
innumerable. King Richard hauing got this victorie, wrote letters
thereof vnto the archbishops, bishops, abbats, earles and barons of his
realme, that they might praise God for his good successe.</p>

<p>&para; A notable example to all princes that haue the conquest ouer their

praise vnto him who giueth victorie vnto whom it pleaseth him. Which the

prosperous affaires to God, as may well be noted by his words, saieng

<p>Now will we staie the proceedings of the king of France at this time,
and make no further relation thereof for a while, till we haue touched
other things that happened in England at the same season. And first ye
shall vnderstand, that Hugh Bardolfe, Roger Arundell, and Geffrey
Hachet, to whom as iustices, the counties of Lincolne, Notingham, Yorke,
Derbie, Northumberland, Westmerland, Cumberland, and Lancaster were
appointed for circuits, held not onelie pl&eacute;es of assises, and of the
<span class="rightnote">Inquisitions taken.</span>
crowne, but also tooke inquisitions of escheats, and forfaitures of all
maner of transgressions, and of donations of benefices, of marriages of
widowes and maids, and other such like things as apperteined to the
king, whereby any aduantages grew to his vse, the which for tediousnesse
we passe ouer. These things were streightlie looked vnto, not without
the disquieting of manie.</p>

<p>Herewith came an other trouble in the necke of this former, to diuerse
persons within the realme, through inquiries taken by the iustices of
the forrests: for Hugh Neuille, Hugh Waley, and Heruisius Neuill,
appointed iustices itinerants in that case, were commanded by the king
to call before them archbishops, bishops, earles, barons, knights, and
fr&eacute;eholders, with the reeue, and foure of the substantiall men of euerie
<span class="rightnote">Ordinances of forrests.</span>
towne or village, to heare and take knowledge of the kings commandement,
touching the ordinances of forrests, the which were verie straight in
sundrie points, so that whereas before those that offended in killing of
the kings deere were punished by the purse, now they should loose their
eies and genitals, as the lawe was in the daies of king Henrie his
grandfather: and those that offended in cutting downe woods or bushes,
or in digging and deluing vp of turues and clods, or by any other maner
of waie made waste and distruction in woods or grasse, or spoile of
venison, within the precinct of the forrests, contrarie to order, they
should be put to their fines.</p>

He gaue commandement also, that it should be lawful to the forresters to

Manie other ordinances were decr&eacute;ed touching the preseruation of
forrests, and the kings prerogatiue, aduantages and profits rising and
growing by the same, as well for sauing of his woods and wasts, as in

<p>Ye haue heard before, how the moonks of Canturburie did send to exhibit
a complaint to the pope, for that their archbishop tooke vpon him to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i></span>
deale in exercise of matters belonging to a temporall man, and not to
such a one as had rule ouer the spiritualtie: but this was not the cause
that did gr&eacute;eue them so much, as that he went forward with the erection
of that church at Lameth, which his predecessor archbishop Baldwine had
first
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" ></a><span class="pagenum">[267]</span>
begun at Haketon, now called S. Stephans (as before ye haue
heard) and after was driuen through the importunate suit of the moonks
to leaue off, and race that which he had there begun, to obeie the popes
<span class="rightnote">The church of Lameth.</span>
pleasure: and after laid a new foundation at Lameth.</p>

<p>The moonks of Canturburie therefore still fearing least that church
should greatlie preiudice such rights and liberties, as they pretended,
namlie in the election of their archbishop, would neuer rest, but still
complained and followed their suit in most obstinate maner in the court
of Rome, as well in the daies of the said Baldwine, as now against
Hubert, (when he tooke in hand to continue the worke according to the
purpose of his predecessour the said Baldwine, which was to haue
instituted a colledge there, and to haue placed secular canons in the
same) and such was the earnest trauell of the moonks herein, that in the
end now after the deceasse of pope Celestine, they found such fauour at
the hands of pope Innocent his successor, that the same Innocent
<span class="rightnote">The pope c&#333;mandeth the church of Lameth to be raced.</span>
directed his letters of c&#333;mandement to the archbishop, and other
bishops of this land, to destroie and race the same foundation, as a
p&eacute;ece of worke derogatorie to the s&eacute;e of Canturburie, and verie
preiudiciall to the estate of holie church.</p>

<p>The archbishop at the first trusted to be borne out by the king (who was
highlie offended with the moonks for their presumptuous dealing) and
therefore refused to obeie the popes commandement. The king in deed
stomached the matter so highlie, that he sent letters vnto the moonks by
no worsse messengers than by Geffrey Fitz Peter, and Hugh Fitz Bardolfe
his iustices, signifieng to them not onelie his high displeasure for
their presumptuous proceedings in their suit without his consent, but
also commanding them to surceasse, and not to proc&eacute;ed further in the
matter by virtue of any such the popes letters, which they had purchased
contrarie to the honour and dignitie of his crowne and realme. Moreouer,
he wrote to the bishops, commanding them to appeale; and to the
archbishop, forbidding him in any wise to breake downe the church which
he had so builded at Lameth.</p>

<p>The shiriffe of Kent also was commanded to seize into his hands all the
<span class="rightnote">The presumtuous stoutnesse of the moonks.</span>
tenements and possessions that belonged to the moonks (a frie of satan
and as one saith verie well of them and the like leuen of lewdnesse,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="nogap">who neuer the lesse were so stout in that quarell, that they would not
prolong one daie of the time appointed by the pope for the racing of
that church. Herevpon the king for his part and the bishops in their
owne behalfes wrote to the pope. Likewise the abbats of Boxeley, Fourd,
Stratford, Roberts-bridge, Stanlie, and Basing Warke, wrote the matter
to him: and againe the pope and the cardinals wrote to the king, to the
archbishops, and bishops: and so letters passed to and fro, till at
length the pope sent a Nuncio of purpose, to signifie his full
determination, as in the next yeare it shall be shewed at full.</p>

<span class="rightnote">Welshmen vanquished. <i>Ger.&nbsp;Dor.</i> ascribeth this victorie vnto

About the same time Geffrey Fitz Peter, lord cheefe iustice of England,
raised a power of men, and went into Wales to succour the tenants of
William de Brause, which were besieged of the king, or rather prince of
that countrie, named Owen, the brother of Cadwalaine, in Mauds castell:
but the lord ch&eacute;efe iustice comming to the reskue of them within, gaue
battell to the aduersaries, and vanquishing them slue three thousand of
them, and seauen hundred of those that were taken prisoners and wounded.
And all the while the warres continued in France, the losse for the most
part still redounded to the Frenchmen. Earle John burnt Newburg, and
tooke eighteene knights of such as were sent to the reskue.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The earle of Leicester.</span>
The earle of Leicester with a small companie came before the castell of
Pascie, which (although the Frenchmen held it) did yet of right belong
vnto the said earle. The souldiors within issued foorth, and being too
strong for the earle, caused him to flee, for otherwise
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" ></a><span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
he had b&eacute;ene
taken. But returning on the morrow after with more companie about him,
and laieng ambushes for the enimie, he approched the said castell, and
trained the Frenchmen foorth till he had them within his danger, and
then causing his men to breake out vpon them tooke an eight&eacute;ene knights,
<span class="rightnote">Marchades.</span>
and a great multitude of other people. Also Marchades with his rout of
Brabanders did the Frenchmen much hurt, in robbing and spoiling the
countries.</p>

<p>About this season the archbishop of Canturburie went ouer into Normandie
to speake with king Richard, and at the French kings request he passed
into France, to common with him of peace, which the French king offered
to conclude, in restoring all the townes and castels which he had taken
(Gisors onelie excepted) and touching the possession and title thereof,
he was contented to put the matter in compremise, to the order and award
of six barons in Normandie to be named by him; and of six barons in
France which king Richard should name. But king Richard would not thus
agr&eacute;e, except the earle of Flanders and others which had forsaken the
French king to take his part, might be comprised in the same peace. At
length yet in Nouember, there was truce taken betwixt the two kings till
the feast of S. Hilarie next insuing.</p>

<p>In the meane time pope Innocent the third, vnderstanding in what present
danger things stood in the holie land, and on the other side,
<span class="rightnote">A truce taken betwixt the two kings.</span>
considering what a weakening it was vnto christendome, to haue these two
kings thus to warre with mortall hatred one against the other: he
thought it stood him vpon to trauell betwixt them, to bring them vnto
some peace and agreement. H&eacute;erevpon he dispatched one Peter the
cardinall of Capua into France, as legat from the s&eacute;e of Rome, vnto the
two foresaid kings, to instruct them in what present danger the state of
the christians in Asia presentlie stood, so that without the aid of them
and of other christian princes, it could not be holpen, but needs it
must come to vtter ruine, and the Saracens yer long to be possessed of
the whole. Therefore both in respect hereof, and also for the auoiding
of the further wilfull spilling of christian bloud in such ciuill<a name="FNanchor_6_17" id="FNanchor_6_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and
vngodlie warre, he besought them to staie their hands, and to ioine in
some fr&eacute;endlie band of concord, whereby they might with mutuall consent
bestow their seruice in that necessarie and most godlie warre, wherein
by ouercomming the enimies of Christ, they might looke for worthie
reward at his hands, which is the fr&eacute;e giuer of all victories.<a name="FNanchor_6_18" id="FNanchor_6_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="yearnote">1199.</span>
The cardinall comming into France, and dooing his message in most
earnest wise, was present at the interuiew appointed betwixt the two
kings in the feast of S. Hilarie, but yet could not he bring his purpose
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> A truce concluded for fiue yeares.</span>
to full effect: onelie he procured them to take truce for the term of
fiue yeares, farther he could not get them to agr&eacute;e. &para; The fault by
authors is ascribed aswell to king Richard, as to king Philip: for king
Richard being first euill vsed, and put to hinderance, determined either
to vanquish, or neuer to giue place.</p>

<p>This forbearance from warre was concluded and taken in the yeare 1199
after the incarnation, and tenth of king Richards reigne. But
immediatlie after, there arose matter of new displeasure betwixt these
two kings to k&eacute;epe their minds in vre with secret grudges, though by
reason of the truce they outwardlie absteined from declaring it by force
<span class="rightnote">Contention about the choosing of the emperour.</span>
of armes. It chanced that in the election of a new emperour, the
electors could not agr&eacute;e, one part of them choosing Otho duke of
Saxonie, nephue to king Richard by his sister Maud, and another part of
them naming Philip duke of Tuscaine, and brother to the last emperour
Henrie.</p>

<p>King Richard (as reason was) did procure what fauour he could to the
furtherance of his nephue Otho: and king Philip on the contrarie part,
did what he could in fauour of the foresaid Philip. At length Otho was
admitted by the pope to end the strife: but yet the grudge remained in
the harts of the two kings: Philip finding himselfe much gr&eacute;eued in that
he had missed his purpose, and Richard being as little pleased for
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269" ></a><span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
that
he had woone his so hardlie, and with so much adoo. And thus matters
passed for that yeare.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i> The popes letters to the king for the church of
Lameth.</span>
In the beginning of the next, the popes Nuncio came with letters, not
onlie to the archbishop and bishops of England, but also to the king
himselfe, signifieng the popes resolute decree touching the church and
colledge of Lameth to be broken downe and suppressed. Wherevpon the king
and archbishop (though sore against their willes) when they saw no waie
longer to shift off the matter, y&eacute;elded to the popes pleasure: and so
the archbishop sent his letters to Lameth, where the 21 daie of Januarie
they were read, and the 27 daie of the same moneth was the church cast
downe, &amp; the canons which were alreadie these placed, had commandement
to depart from thence without further delaie. Thus the moonks in dispite
<span class="rightnote">The moonks borne out by the pope.</span>
of the king and archbishop had their willes, but yet their vexation
ceassed not, for the king and archbishop bearing them no small euill
will, for that they had so obteined their purpose contrarie to their
minds and intents, molested them diuerse waies, although the moonks
still vpon complaint to the pope, were verie much releeued, and found
great freendship both with him and likewise with his court. &para; So that it
may be obserued that these dishclouts of the popes kitchen haue in all
ages, since their first quickening b&eacute;ene troublesome and mutinous,
sawcie and insolent, proud<a name="FNanchor_6_19" id="FNanchor_6_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and malapert. But,</p>

<p>In this meane time, king Richard being now at rest from troubles of
warre, studied busilie to prouide monie, meaning to make a new voiage
into the holie land. Therefore finding himselfe beare of treasure, by
<span class="rightnote">A tax. <br />

Chasteau Galiard built.</span>
reason of the French warres had emptied his cofers, he set a great tax
vpon his subiects, and by that meanes, hauing recouered a great summe,
he builded that notable strong castell in Normandie, vpon the banke of
the riuer of Saine, named Chateau Galiard: which when it was finished he
fell a iesting thereat and said; "Behold, is not this a faire daughter
of one yeares growth." The soile where this castell was builded,
belonged to the archbishop of Rouen, for which there followed great
strife betwixt the king and the archbishop, till the pope tooke vp the
matter (as before ye haue heard.)</p>

<p>After this, he determined to chastise certeine persons in Poictou, which
during the warres betwixt him and the French king, had aided the
<span class="rightnote">Images of an emperour and of his wife &amp; children all of fine
gold. The annales of Aquitaine.</span>
Frenchmen against him: wherevpon with an armie he passed foorth towards
them, but by the waie he was informed, that one Widomer a vicount in the
countrie of Britaine, had found great treasure: and therefore pretending
a right thereto by vertue of his prerogatiue, he sent for the vicount,
who smelling out the matter, and supposing the king would not be
indifferent in parting the treasure, fled into Limosin, where although
the people were tributaries to the king of England, yet they tooke part
with the French king.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Chalus Cheuerell. <i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
There is a towne in that countrie called Chalus Cheuerell, into which
the said vicount retired for safegard of himselfe, and then gaue the
townesmen a great portion of treasure, to the end they should defend him
and his quarell for the rest. King Richard still following him, as one
that could not auoid his fatall ordinance, hasted into the confines of
Limosin, fullie determining either to win the towne by force, if the
inhabitants should make resistance, or at leastwise, to get into his
hands the preie, which he so earnestlie pursued. At his first approch he
<span class="rightnote">K. Richard besiegeth Chalus.</span>
gaue manie fierce assaults to the towne, but they within hauing
throughlie prouided aforehand for to defend a siege, so resisted his
attempts, that within thr&eacute;e daies after his comming, he ceassed to
assaile the towne, meaning to vndermine the walles, which otherwise he
perceiued would verie hardlie be gotten; considering the stoutnesse of
them within, and withall, the naturall strength and situation of the
place it selfe.</p>

<p>Herevpon therefore on the 26 of March, whiles he (togither with capteine
Marchades)
<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" ></a><span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
went about vnaduisedlie to view the towne (the better to
consider the place which waie he might conueie the course of his mine)
<span class="rightnote">He is wounded.</span>
they came so farre within danger, that the king was stricken in the left
arme, or (as some write) in the shoulder, where it ioined to the necke,
with a quarell inuenomed (as is to be supposed by the sequele.) Being
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ra.&nbsp;Niger.</i></span>
thus wounded, he gat to his horsse, and rode home againe to his lodging,
where he caused the wound to be searched and bound vp, and as a man
nothing dismaid therewith, continued his siege with such force and
assurance, that within 12 daies after the mishap, the towne was y&eacute;elded
vnto him, although verie little treasure (to make any great accompt of)
was at that time found therein.</p>

<p>In this meane season, the king had committed the cure of his wound to
one of Marchades his surgions, who taking in hand to plucke out the
quarell, drew foorth onelie the shaft at the first<a name="FNanchor_6_20" id="FNanchor_6_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, and left the iron
still within, and afterwards going about most vnskilfullie to get foorth
the head of the said quarell, he vsed such incisions, and so mangled the
<span class="rightnote">The king despaired of life.</span>
kings arme, yer he could cut it, that he himself despaired of all helpe
and longer life, affirming flatlie to such as stood about him, that he
could not long continue by reason of his butcherlie handling. To be
short f&eacute;eling himselfe to wax weaker and weaker, preparing his mind to
death, which he perceiued now to be at hand, he ordeined his testament,
<span class="rightnote">He ordeineth his testament.</span>
or rather reformed and added sundrie things vnto the same which he
before had made, at the time of his gooing foorth towards the holie
land.</p>

<p>Vnto his brother Iohn he assigned the crowne of England, and all other
his lands and dominions, causing the Nobles there present to sweare
fealtie vnto him. His monie, his iewels, and all other his goods
<span class="rightnote"><i>R.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
mooueable he willed to be diuided into thr&eacute;e parts, of the which Otho
the emperor his sisters sonne to haue one, his houshold seruants an
other part, and the third to be distributed to the poore. Finallie
remembring himselfe also of the place of his buriall, he commanded that
his bodie should be interred at Fonteurard at his fathers feet, but he
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
willed his heart to be conueied vnto Rouen, and there buried, in
testimonie of the loue which he had euer borne vnto that citie for the
stedfast faith and tried loialtie at all times found in the citizens
there. His bowels he ordeined to be buried in Poictiers, as in a place
naturallie vnthankefull and not worthie to reteine any of the more
honorable parts of his bodie.</p>

<p>Moreouer he caused the arcubalistar that wounded him, to be sought out,
whose name was Barthram de Garden<a name="FNanchor_6_21" id="FNanchor_6_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, or Peter Basill (for so he named
himselfe as some write) who being brought before the king, he demanded
<span class="rightnote"><i>Rog.&nbsp;Houed.</i></span>
wherein he had so much offended him, that he should so lie in wait to
slea him, rather than Marchades, who was then in his companie, and
attendant on his person? The other answered boldlie againe, saieng; "I
purposed to kill thee, bicause thou sluest my father, and two of my
brethren heretofore, and wouldest also now haue slaine me, if I had
happened to fall into thy hands. Wherefore I intended to reuenge their
deaths, not caring in the meane time what became of my selfe, so that I
might in anie wise obteine my will of th&eacute;e, who in such sort hast bereft
me of my freends." The king harkening vnto his words, and pondering his
<span class="rightnote">A notable example of forgiuing an enimie. <i>Matth.&nbsp;Paris.</i></span>
talke by good aduisement, fr&eacute;elie pardoned him, and withall commanded
that he should be set at libertie, and thereto haue an hundred shillings
giuen him in his pursse, and so to be let go. Moreouer, he gaue strait
charge that no<a name="FNanchor_6_22" id="FNanchor_6_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> man should hurt him, or s&eacute;eke any reuenge for this his
death hereafter. Thus the penitent prince not onelie forgaue, but also
rewarded his aduersarie. Howbeit after his deceasse, Marchades getting
him into his hands, first caused the skin to be stripped off his bodie,
and after hanged him on a gibit.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">King Richard departed this life.</span>
At length king Richard by force of sicknesse (increased with anguish of
his incurable wound) departed this life, on the tuesdaie before
Palmesundaie, being the ninth of Aprill, and the xj. daie after he was
hurt, in the yeare after the birth of our Sauiour 1199. in the 44 yeare
of his age, and after he had reigned nine yeares, nine moneths, and od
<span class="rightnote">His stature &amp; shape of bodie. <i>Gal.&nbsp;Vinsaf.</i></span>
daies: he left no issue behind him. He was tall of stature, and well
proportioned, faire and comelie of face, so as in his countenance
appeared much fauour and grauitie, of haire
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" ></a><span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
bright aborne, as it were
betwixt red and yellow, with long armes, and nimble in all his ioints
his thighes and legs were of due proportion, and answerable to the other
parts of his bodie.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">His disposition of mind.</span>
As he was comelie of personage, so was he of stomach more couragious and
fierce, so that not without cause, he obteined the surname of Cueur de
lion, that is to saie, The lions hart. Moreouer he was courteous to his
souldiors, and towards his fr&eacute;ends and strangers that resorted vnto him
verie liberall, but to his enimies hard and not to be intreated,
desirous of battell, an enimie to rest and quietnesse, verie eloquent of
speech and wise, but readie to enter into ieopardies, and that without
feare or forecast in time of greatest perils.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">The vices that were in king Richard.</span>
These were his vertuous qualities, but his vices (if his vertues, his
age, and the wars which he mainteined were throughlie weied) were either
none at all, or else few in number, and not verie notorious. He was
noted of the common people to be partlie subiect vnto pride, which
surelie for the most part foloweth stoutnesse of mind: of incontinencie,
to the which his youth might happilie be somewhat bent: and of
couetousnesse, into the which infamie most captieins and such princes as
commonlie follow the warres doo oftentimes fall, when of the necessitie
they are driuen to exact monie, as well of fr&eacute;ends as enimies, to
mainteine the infinit charges of their wars.</p>

<p>Hereof it came, that on a time whiles he soiourned in France about his
warres, which he held against K. Philip, there came vnto him a French
<span class="rightnote">Fulco a pr&eacute;est.</span>
pr&eacute;est whose name was Fulco, who required the K. in any wise to put from
him thr&eacute;e abhominable daughters which he had, and to bestow them in
marriage, least God punished him for them. Thou liest hypocrite (said
the king) to thy verie face, for all the world knoweth that I haue not
one daughter. I lie not (said the pr&eacute;est) for thou hast thr&eacute;e daughters,
one of them is called pride, the second couetousnesse, and the third
lecherie. With that the king, called to him his lords &amp; barons, and said
to them; "This hypocrite heere hath required me to marrie awaie my thr&eacute;e
daughters, which (as he saith) I cherish, nourish, foster and mainteine,
that is to say pride, couetousnesse, and lecherie. And now that I haue
found out necessarie &amp; fit husbands for them, I will doo it with effect,
and seeke no more delaies. I therefore bequeath my pride to the high
minded templers and hospitallers, which are as proud as Lucifer
himselfe. My couetousnesse I giue vnto the white moonks, otherwise
called of the Cisteaux order, for they couet the diuell and all. My
lecherie I commit to the prelates of the church, who haue most pleasure
and felicitie therein."</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Baldwine &amp; Hubert archbishops of Canturburie.</span>
There liued in the daies of this king Richard, men of worthie fame
amongst those of the cleargie, Baldwine archbishop of Canturburie, and
Hubert who succeeded him in that s&eacute;e, also Hugh bishop of Lincolne, a
man for his worthinesse of life highlie to be commended. Moreouer,
William bishop of Elie, who though otherwise he was to be dispraised for
his ambition and pompous hautinesse, yet the king vsed his seruice for a

Also of learned men we find diuerse in these daies that flourished here

Germanie, and from imprisonment, a quarter of wheat was sold at 18
shillings eight pence, no small price in those daies, if you consider
the alay of monie then currant.</p>

<p>Also immediatlie after, that is to say, in the yeare of our Lord, a
thousand, one hundred, nintie six, which was about the seuenth yere of
<span class="rightnote">A great mortalitie of people. <i>Wil.&nbsp;Paruus.</i></span>
the said kings reigne, there followed a maruellous sore death, which
dailie consumed such numbers of people, that scarse there might be found
any to k&eacute;epe and looke to those that were sicke, or to burie them that
died. Which sickenesse was a pestilentiall feuer or sharpe burning ague.
The accustomed manner of buriall was also neglected: so that in manie
places they made great pits, and threw their dead bodies into the same,
one vpon an other. For the multitude of them that died was such, that
they could not haue time to make for euerie one a seuerall graue. This
mortalitie continued for the space of fiue or six months, and at length
ceassed in the cold season of winter.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">Two sunnes.</span>
In the octaues of Pentecost before this great death, in the first houre
of the day, there appeared two sunnes, the true sunne &amp; another, as it
were a counterfeit sunne: but so apparentlie, that hard it was to the
common people, to discerne the one from the other. The skilfull also
were compelled by instruments to distinguish the one from the other: in
taking their altitudes and places, whereby in the end they found the new
apparition, as it were, to wait vpon the planet, and so continued by the
space of certeine houres. At length when the beholders (of whom Wil.
Paruus that recorded things in that age was one) had well wearied their
eies in diligent marking the maner of this strange appearance, the
counterfeit sunne vanished awaie.</p>

<p>&para; This strange woonder was taken for a signification of that which
followed, that is to say, of war, famine and pestilence: or to say the
truth, it betokened rather the continuance of two of those mischiefs.
For warre and famine had sore afflicted the people before that time, and
as yet ceassed not: but as for the pestilence, it began soone after the
strange sight, whereof insued such effect, as I haue alreadie rehearsed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
